- line: "This week we'll talk about self-studying and continuous learning in machine\
    \ learning and bioinformatics. We have a special guest today, Aaisha. Aaisha is\
    \ a self-taught bioinformatician, machine learning engineer, and data scientist\
    \ from Johannesburg, South Africa. She graduated from Machine Learning Zoomcamp\
    \ that we have here in the DataTalks.Club and she studied Python and basic web\
    \ development. She also maintains a blog on bioinformatics and machine learning\
    \ topics. Beyond that, she is interested in many other things, such as photography\
    \ and digital art. Maybe if you saw the picture we have for the cover today \u2013\
    \ there is this space mushroom, this is what we talked about \u2013 this is something\
    \ Aaisha drew. Welcome to our interview today."

  who: Alexey
- header: "Aaisha\u2019s background"
- line: Let's start. Before we go into our main topic of self-study and continuous
    learning in machine learning and bioinformatics, let's start with your background.
    Can you tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 137
  time: '2:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: "My career journey, I would say, is just beginning still, considering I'm\
    \ basically a student. I've been mostly doing my studies up to now. I started\
    \ studying Python quite a few years ago. I don't remember how old I was \u2013\
    \ I think I was like 12, or something, or 11 maybe. I did introductory Python\
    \ and then I did JavaScript and HTML and CSS \u2013 the standard, \u201CI want\
    \ to do coding, what do I do?\u201D package. Then I discovered data science and\
    \ bioinformatics and I was like, \u201COkay, this is a cool field to go into.\u201D\
    \ And I started studying that."
  sec: 150
  time: '2:30'
  who: Aaisha
- line: "I was also studying biology and chemistry and the more science-y fields.\
    \ Recently, I started going into more machine learning and actually focusing on\
    \ trying to build my career in machine learning. So that is my goal now \u2013\
    \ to establish myself in machine learning and still be able to do my bioinformatics\
    \ along with it. If there's some way I can merge these two different fields I've\
    \ been doing. And then scientific illustration is something I want to pursue on\
    \ the side, maybe as a second field or something like that."
  sec: 150
  time: '2:30'
  who: Aaisha
- line: "Scientific illustration \u2013 what is that?"
  sec: 225
  time: '3:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Like in the New York Times? Or the New York Times is different. Maybe they're
    not so much scientific, but I think I know what you mean.
  sec: 241
  time: '4:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I've seen that there are scientific illustrations published in the New York\
    \ Times as well. So that's one of them. Then it\u2019s also just generally making\
    \ art to explain science, basically. That\u2019s how I describe it. It\u2019s\
    \ explaining science through art in a visually engaging, appealing manner for\
    \ people who are maybe not so much into science. They just have a general interest\
    \ in science. It\u2019s dejargonifying science and explaining it in an easy, nice\
    \ manner. That\u2019s what I consider scientific illustration \u2013 or art as\
    \ a whole."
  sec: 248
  time: '4:08'
  who: Aaisha
- line: "I think we had a podcast episode maybe over a year ago or so. It was with\
    \ Meor and we talked about visualizing machine learning. We spent most of the\
    \ time of that interview discussing how exactly Meor comes to his visualizations\
    \ \u2013 how he goes from a concept to an illustration and what the process is.\
    \ Probably it's related, right?"
  sec: 281
  time: '4:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, it's a similar thing.
  sec: 309
  time: '5:09'
  who: Aaisha
- line: "Okay. You said you started studying Python 12 years ago or so \u2013 quite\
    \ some time ago. [cross-talk]"
  sec: 311
  time: '5:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, it wasn't that long ago. I was 12 myself. I was 12 years old.
  sec: 321
  time: '5:21'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Ah. 12 months ago, not 12 years?
  sec: 326
  time: '5:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: "No, it wasn't 12 months ago \u2013 I was 12 years old when I started studying\
    \ Python. It was five or six years ago."

  who: Aaisha
- header: How homeschooling affects self-study
- line: I see. What I'm trying to ask is, you're not taking these classes as any part
    of a formal education, right?. You're just going on the internet, finding things
    there to study and you just study them, right? Or how does it work? How do you
    learn all these things?
  sec: 337
  time: '5:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: I wouldn't say I just go on the internet and just start studying things. I
    try not to be randomly pursuing everything I find interesting. [cross-talk]
  sec: 358
  time: '5:58'
  who: Aaisha
- line: "But it\u2019s formal education, right? It's self-study. You\u2019re not doing\
    \ this at university."
  sec: 368
  time: '6:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, it\u2019s self-study. I've been homeschooled, so technically I haven't\
    \ gone through any formal education. I went to school. I've not gone to uni. Technically,\
    \ if I was going to school, I would be going to uni now. I'm not going to uni.\
    \ I've not been to any school. Everything I know, either my mom used to teach\
    \ me before that or self-study. So I\u2019m either homeschooled or self-taught."
  sec: 371
  time: '6:11'
  who: Aaisha
- line: "Interesting. I don't think I\u2019ve ever spoken to anyone who was homeschooled.\
    \ How did it feel?"
  sec: 397
  time: '6:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's such a difficult question to answer. I don't know what it would feel
    like going to school because I've literally never gone to school. [chuckles]
  sec: 405
  time: '6:45'
  who: Aaisha
- line: But it would be your mother just teaching you some stuff and then eventually,
    maybe it was just you studying things?
  sec: 416
  time: '6:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. Obviously, when I was a kid there were my parents who would teach. We'd
    study whatever. We never followed a curriculum or anything. At that point, that's
    why I started studying programming or scientific stuff much earlier than I think
    I would have gotten in school. I found it interesting, so my mum would gather
    resources and let me learn it and teach me or whatever. After that, once I was
    old enough, I just started studying by myself online with online resources and
    stuff.
  sec: 423
  time: '7:03'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Interesting. Well, when my kid is sick, we need to do some homeschooling too.
    I just don't have the patience to actually sit with him and explain all this stuff.
    So your parents must be very patient people.
  sec: 459
  time: '7:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes. [chuckles] My parents put up with a lot of stuff.
  sec: 473
  time: '7:53'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Well, I guess you have more flexibility this way. So if you want to travel,
    you just go and travel. Right?
  sec: 478
  time: '7:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. Even not just traveling, but just in what I'm studying. There's so\
    \ much more flexibility than in school where you're studying one thing and you\
    \ can't study everything you want because you have to follow the school system.\
    \ This way I can study things \u2013 I can pick and choose what I want to study.\
    \ If there's something I already know, then I don't have to go through it again\
    \ like I would have to in a school curriculum."
  sec: 484
  time: '8:04'
  who: Aaisha
- header: Deciding on what to learn about
- line: "What I wanted to ask you next was what motivated you to take this approach.\
    \ I guess you kind of answered that already because you have been doing self-studying\
    \ since forever \u2013 since school days. [Aaisha agrees] So maybe what is interesting\
    \ is \u2013 how do you decide to learn? There are so many things on the internet.\
    \ You open any data science subreddit or any data science community and then you're\
    \ immediately bombarded with all these links and all these new things. Then you\u2019\
    re like \u201COkay, I have to study all that. And if I don't have this I fear\
    \ of missing out.\u201D So how do you approach this systematically? How do you\
    \ not go crazy when you need to do this? [cross-talk]"
  sec: 513
  time: '8:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: "As a general topic \u2013 let\u2019s say I want to study bioinformatics or\
    \ whatever \u2013 I think I started following it out of interest a bit more, because\
    \ I always wanted to do this cool scientific research and stuff. But it hasn't\
    \ always been possible to pursue that path. Then I discovered that there's something\
    \ more realistic within my reach that I can do with tech stuff online and with\
    \ the resources I have available. I still get to do the quiz science-y stuff,\
    \ but it's practical because I can do it. That is how I began studying it."
  sec: 561
  time: '9:21'
  who: Aaisha
- line: "In regards to finding resources, maybe I did waste a bit too much time doing\
    \ introductory Python courses. [chuckles] Because I was like, \u201COkay, well\
    \ I did this course and I did that course,\u201D and I faffed around for a while.\
    \ But then, I think I've just gotten good at finding the \u201Cgood\u201D resources.\
    \ You get the hang of it after doing it for a while \u2013 finding out that these\
    \ are the best resources. It also helped that I had a sort of guideline in my\
    \ mind of what I need to know. I need to know this much of biology or chemistry\
    \ or whatever and my Python skills need to be at this level."
  sec: 561
  time: '9:21'
  who: Aaisha
- line: For bioinformatics, specifically, I found this really cool pathway made by
    the Open Source Society University, where they make these tracks and stuff. So
    I followed that. I think, generally, filtering out information is a skill [audio
    cuts out].
  sec: 561
  time: '9:21'
  who: Aaisha
- line: You were talking about different tracks. There are some open curricula online
    and you found some tracks for bioinformatics and this is what you studied.
  sec: 753
  time: '12:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. I was saying that, in general, for finding resources, I think studying\
    \ a lot of them online helps with that. You can start curating the resources that\
    \ you find and know, \u201COkay, this covers this skill set. Maybe this is not\
    \ what I need right now. It might be cool, but maybe I can do it at some later\
    \ point and not now.\u201D You can also find communities where people have gathered\
    \ resources, \u201COkay, to achieve this certain skill set, this is what you need\
    \ to learn.\u201D And then you can either follow those specific resources, or\
    \ you can find alternative resources."
  sec: 768
  time: '12:48'
  who: Aaisha
- line: "But I think majorly what has helped is having an idea in my mind of what\
    \ skills I need. If I want to pursue machine learning, I need a basic introductory\
    \ look at machine learning. That's why I did the Zoomcamp in the first place.\
    \ I was like, \u201COkay, this seems like a good resource to get my basics down.\u201D\
    \ Then once I know a bit more about the field, then I can decide, \u201COkay,\
    \ what skills do I need to develop further?\u201D"
  sec: 768
  time: '12:48'
  who: Aaisha
- header: Establishing whether a resource is good
- line: "I have so many questions based on what you just said. There are so many interesting\
    \ directions. First of all, you said that you developed a feeling \u2013 when\
    \ you look at the resource, you know that it's good. I wonder \u2013 how does\
    \ it work? How do you know? Let's say you look at a Zoomcamp \u2013 of course,\
    \ the Zoomcamp is maybe not a very good example. [chuckles] Let's not take Zoomcamp.\
    \ Let\u2019s say you take a resource. How do you know if it's good? How do you\
    \ understand that?"
  sec: 829
  time: '13:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: "There are a few things I look at. The first one I do is skim the syllabus\
    \ or whatever and then see if the content that they're teaching is something that\
    \ I need right now \u2013 if it's applicable to me right now. Obviously, there's\
    \ so much good stuff that I want to learn and I'm like, \u201COkay, maybe knowing\
    \ exactly how stars explode in space is not something I need to know right now.\u201D\
    \ Obviously, that's something I just throw out the window then and there. But\
    \ then say I pick up a course on machine learning and I see that \u201COkay, the\
    \ syllabus is good. It's teaching me how to use a framework that I need to know\
    \ right now.\u201D Then I watch the introductory videos and see that \u201COkay,\
    \ does it feel like this course is offering quality? Does it look like something\
    \ that is being taught in a good way? Does it look like the people know what they're\
    \ talking about? Or am I gonna get ripped off here?\u201D That kind of thing \u2013\
    \ just gauging the general quality of it."
  sec: 862
  time: '14:22'
  who: Aaisha
- line: "If you were to pick up a book and you flip a few pages around, read a bit,\
    \ and you'd see, \u201COkay, does this look like something that is quality? Or\
    \ does it look like somebody just wrote a bunch of stuff that they don't know\
    \ what they're talking about and published it.\u201D Because obviously, on the\
    \ internet, it's like that YouTube stereotype where there are people on YouTube\
    \ who don't know what they're talking about. But there are so many good resources\
    \ on YouTube as well. You can get an idea for how much the person knows what they're\
    \ talking about, how beneficial it might be, if you skim through it a bit and\
    \ just pick out bits and pieces and listen to them or whatever. Then you can decide\
    \ that \u201COkay, up to now, this looks like something that's good.\u201D And\
    \ then you can commit to studying it and then see how it is."
  sec: 862
  time: '14:22'
  who: Aaisha
- line: You mainly look at free resources? Or do you also consider paid courses?
  sec: 962
  time: '16:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I try to go for free where possible, obviously, because it's more affordable.\
    \ But if it\u2019s good resources, I'm not averse to investing in it. If this\
    \ is something that will benefit me or my career down the line, then it's a worthwhile\
    \ investment. But I will make sure that if I'm invested in something, then it\
    \ is quality and it is worth it. I will try to avoid investing in something that\
    \ I can learn with free resources, even if it's a harder study or whatever."
  sec: 967
  time: '16:07'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Skimming a paid course might be more difficult, right? Because you don't have
    access to the course, usually. Maybe some parts, but you don't usually get the
    access to the course to know if it's good or not. So you cannot really check it
    out in advance.
  sec: 999
  time: '16:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: "For a paid resource, I'd go more like, \u201COkay, who's the author that\
    \ published it? Is there any free content that they've put out?\u201D Somewhere\
    \ where I can get a general idea for their sort of content elsewhere \u2013 aside\
    \ from this one paid course. You can get a general profiling of who is teaching\
    \ the course before you pay for it \u2013 see if it's credible or not, see their\
    \ credentials, what work they've done, that kind of thing."

  sec: 1014
  time: '16:54'
  who: Aaisha
- line: "It\u2019s funny that you mentioned information about how stars explode, because\
    \ this is what I was just reading the other day. That's pretty cool stuff and\
    \ it's quite interesting. But maybe, like in this example, if you study machine\
    \ learning, then obviously astronomy is not super relevant to that. At least most\
    \ of astronomy. This is kind of a no-brainer. If you want to learn about linear\
    \ regression, you know that how stars explode is not\u2026"
  sec: 1041

  who: Alexey
- line: "[chuckles] It\u2019s not going to help you."
  sec: 1069
  time: '17:49'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Yeah. But when it comes to machine learning, there are many things. For example,
    when I was studying machine learning, I thought that support vector machines are
    super important to understand. Also because I was taking a machine learning class
    at the University and at that university, the teacher was doing a lot of research
    on support vector machines. I thought that it's very important to really understand
    these things well.
  sec: 1071
  time: '17:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: "But when I started working, I understood that nobody really cares about them\
    \ \u2013 support vector machines are not really useful anymore. So how do you\
    \ understand that? How do you understand these things? Okay, astronomy is not\
    \ relevant, but when it comes to machine learning, there are some topics that\
    \ are perhaps more relevant, some are less relevant. So how do you understand\
    \ which direction to go?"
  sec: 1071
  time: '17:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: "This is just something you do and then realize, \u201COkay, it wasn't that\
    \ needed.\u201D I spent a lot of time doing a data science course that had a lot\
    \ of data visualization, and also data cleaning and everything. At that point,\
    \ I was like, \u201COkay, maybe this is not the direction I want to go in.\u201D\
    \ It's not that important. I was doing it for machine learning or data science\
    \ more. Seeing how the data is cleaned is maybe good knowledge to have, but maybe\
    \ not as relevant as what I wanted to do then. I did it and maybe it will come\
    \ in handy later, but at the time it was not what I was looking for. I think that's\
    \ just something you have to figure out, that this was not as relevant, after\
    \ the fact that you studied it. Because there's no way you know that without studying\
    \ it."
  sec: 1117
  time: '18:37'
  who: Aaisha
- line: "There\u2019s no silver bullet. Okay. I thought maybe you would just tell\
    \ me \u201COkay, do that and that. Then you know what is relevant.\u201D"
  sec: 1165
  time: '19:25'
  who: Alexey

    share with me. [chuckles]'
  sec: 1172
  time: '19:32'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Well, I guess in this case, the community is helpful. You can always ask people
    who went through it.
  sec: 1177
  time: '19:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I think to some degree, maybe you can get an idea by doing your own research\
    \ or finding people more in the field and if they have done interviews or question/answers,\
    \ you could ask them. Communities could be helpful. But I think to some degree,\
    \ it's unavoidable that you end up studying something and you're like, \u201C\
    Okay, maybe it wasn't that important.\u201D At least in my experience."
  sec: 1184
  time: '19:44'
  who: Aaisha
- line: "Sorry, I interrupted. I just wanted to say that while doing my Master's,\
    \ and also my Bachelor\u2019s, I also studied a lot of stuff that is not relevant.\
    \ Maybe if I was doing self-study instead, then things would have been different,\
    \ right? Maybe I would have actually spent more time on studying things that are\
    \ relevant, not because of what the teachers thought."
  sec: 1212
  time: '20:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: There was somebody who mentioned that they were studying computer science
    and they said that for the first two years of the curriculum, they didn't touch
    computer science at all. They must learn English, math and chemistry. It's funny
    how the school system works. Why must you study chemistry in your university when
    you're majoring in computer science? That's one thing to have basic knowledge
    of.
  sec: 1238
  time: '20:38'
  who: Aaisha
- line: And it's one thing that you're studying in university when you're trying to
    study computer science. Whereas you could just focus on computer science and learn
    whatever is necessary and if there are any gaps in your knowledge, you can also
    go back and study it later. It's not like if you didn't study chemistry in your
    first year, but then you need it in your fourth year, it's the end of the world.
  sec: 1238
  time: '20:38'
  who: Aaisha
- line: Yeah, indeed. Well, I did not have that when I was studying computer science.
    Well, we had chemistry later. [cross-talk]
  sec: 1281
  time: '21:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: It also depends on where you're studying. I'm just giving an example.
  sec: 1289
  time: '21:29'
  who: Aaisha
- line: "We did have chemistry, but later, in the third grade. It was clear why we\
    \ did. I mean, I had fun, I like chemistry. It was cool. At university, I also\
    \ kind of enjoyed it, but it's not something I really needed to know apart from\
    \ having pleasure from studying this, and not the obligation. Yeah, but we did\
    \ spend a lot of time studying math. While it was fun \u2013 I enjoyed solving\
    \ all these equations of these things \u2013 again, at my work as a data scientist,\
    \ most of these things aren\u2019t really needed."

  time: '21:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It's one thing to have to study something because you find it interesting,\
    \ or if you want to go into a research field or something so you study it. But\
    \ I think in a day-to-day application, you're hardly going to need a lot of this\
    \ kind of stuff. And if you need it, again, say you\u2019re pursuing a career\
    \ path and you're like, \u201COkay, this is needed,\u201D you can study it then,\
    \ instead of wasting all of your time studying it when you could be building up\
    \ a main skill instead."

- line: How do you approach this? How do you approach learning? Do you focus on building
    projects? Do you focus on learning theory first? How does it work for you in general?
  sec: 1362
  time: '22:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I think a balance of both is needed. Obviously, without building projects,\
    \ there's always that aspect to just theory, which is lacking. You could know\
    \ something very well in theory, but in practice, your knowledge will end up falling\
    \ short and you run into issues, which you wouldn't have in knowing how to solve\
    \ with just a theory. But I also think learning new things in theory is important,\
    \ like building new skills, or advancing your skill set, especially in something\
    \ like tech if you build more projects in a particular field. But then you're\
    \ not learning new skills. At some point, you're gonna be like, \u201COkay, these\
    \ skills that I have are outdated. And I spent all my time building a bunch of\
    \ projects with a skill that's now falling out of the market.\u201D"
