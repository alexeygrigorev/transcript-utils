- line: This week, we will talk about growing a data engineering team in a scale-up.
    We have a special guest today, Mehdi. I know Mehdi as a content creator and a
    data engineer. We live in the same city, Berlin, and this is how we met. It was
    actually near Alexanderplatz, where I work. He has over eight years of experience
    in data and engineering. Now he works as a staff lead engineer. Today we will
    talk about scaling data teams in a scale-up. Welcome.

  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, thanks for welcoming me on the show with such praise on my YouTube channel.
    I need to keep up the game now.

  who: Mehdi
- header: "Mehdi\u2019s background"
- line: Before we go into our main topic, let's start with your background. Can you
    tell us about your career journey so far?
  sec: 155
  time: '2:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, sure. I started, as you mentioned, about eight years ago in the data\
    \ world, doing classic BI with Microsoft tooling, and mostly click, and drag-and-drop\
    \ tooling. And then I had quite quickly the opportunity to jump early on a Big\
    \ Data project \u2013 an on-premise Adobe cluster back then \u2013 and I just\
    \ surfed on that wave, because back then there were few resources to do such work\
    \ at scale. A lot of companies started to invest into their on-premise cluster\
    \ so I had a kind of R&D project. But again, remember, cloud was there but, not\
    \ as popular and without free tier. Basically, if you wanted to have a playground,\
    \ it already cost you a lot of money. [chuckles]"
  sec: 162
  time: '2:42'
  who: Mehdi
- line: "I just surfed on that wave, built my skills around data engineering, mostly\
    \ Big Data infrastructure. I worked in corporate and then moved out from Belgium\
    \ about three years ago, trying new tech companies, like Klarna and the bike market.\
    \ Those experiences, the last work experience was mostly in a scale-up company.\
    \ I think the environment is pretty different from a standard company. And that's\
    \ where I am today \u2013 I just started as a staff data engineer now."
  sec: 162
  time: '2:42'
  who: Mehdi
- line: Do you miss the days when you had to have an on-premise Hadoop cluster to
    do analytics or Big Data? [cross-talk]
  sec: 262
  time: '4:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I don't. I hate it. I think the barrier to entry was so high \u2013 you needed\
    \ an entire team, there were so many skills needed, like networking, setting up\
    \ servers\u2026 I mean, networking you still do on the cloud, but not as heavy\
    \ when you have to order the machine to the data center and configure your network\
    \ infrastructure itself. So yeah."
  sec: 271
  time: '4:31'
  who: Mehdi
- line: "I remember we had four servers from Hetzner \u2013 four machines \u2013 and\
    \ then we had a Hadoop cluster there. Not only was it constantly breaking \u2013\
    \ we didn't have a team to look after it \u2013 but also, most of the time, it\
    \ was idle, and we (data scientists) would just SSH to one of these servers to\
    \ do some data science stuff. If somebody wanted to run a Hadoop job there, you\
    \ had to prioritize [chuckles]."
  sec: 298
  time: '4:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Exactly. Before, when you were running a big job, you were blocking everybody,\
    \ so people were coming to your desk. Now you\u2019re just burning your credit\
    \ card. So it\u2019s at the end of the month that people come to your desk."
  sec: 325
  time: '5:25'
  who: Mehdi
- header: The difference between startup, scale-up and enterprise
- line: "[laughs] So what does it mean to be a scale-up? I know what a startup is\
    \ \u2013 a startup is a company that just started up. I also know more or less\
    \ what an enterprise is \u2013 it\u2019s a huge company with a lot of people working\
    \ there. So what is a scale-up? Is it something in between? Or what is it?"
  sec: 341
  time: '5:41'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I think there is a different understanding of what a scale-up is. But, roughly\
    \ speaking, it\u2019s a company that is in hyper-growth. So it's usually a company\
    \ that has already achieved first revenues and they have another big funding series\
    \ to basically scale-up their team because the pace to which they get the user\
    \ is faster to the engineering team. At a certain point, they have other challenges,\
    \ so they need other skills \u2013 so they are heavily recruiting."
  sec: 360
  time: '6:00'
  who: Mehdi
- line: "It's usually a company that goes from, I don't know, something like 80 people\
    \ to 400, in like two years or one year even. When I was at Klarna it was like\
    \ 30 people joining every month. I would say that it\u2019s mostly the environment.\
    \ Connected to that you have decisions that need to be made quickly, so it's not\
    \ an environment where you have time. You still need to prove yourself on the\
    \ markets, or you\u2019re in competition, so the driven decision for certain features\
    \ are going faster."
  sec: 360
  time: '6:00'
  who: Mehdi
- line: When you describe it, I imagine an environment where it's just a bunch of
    people, a lot of users, and everything is all fire and everyone is running around
    screaming. [chuckles] Is it similar to that?
  sec: 448
  time: '7:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, it's roughly correct. Yeah. I mean, I think if I look at the different\
    \ companies I have been working with, they have different challenges at different\
    \ times. Maybe they\u2019ve launched a new product, maybe they\u2019ve launched\
    \ something else. A classic challenge is when a European company scales to the\
    \ US. It's a completely different dimension of users and of their usage. If you\
    \ do, for example, B2B and you have one customer that has shopping and you serve\
    \ something on the e-commerce over there \u2013 it has so much impact because\
    \ it's so big that it's way bigger than what you can have on the European market.\
    \ So that brings other challenges downstream. This is one example."
  sec: 461
  time: '7:41'
  who: Mehdi
- line: Another example is a new product feature, which is quite challenging. I think
    it really depends, but there is always a lot of stuff on fire and you need to
    basically make compromises to see what the biggest one to focus on is. [chuckles]
  sec: 461
  time: '7:41'
  who: Mehdi
- line: And not only that, you also need to grow a team, right? You need to quickly
    fix things, like your production issues, in such a way that maybe you will regret
    later, but you need to fix it up anyway. Then you also need to hire a lot of people
    and then all these people come and also add some code fixes. I guess it's quite
    a challenge, right?
  sec: 542
  time: '9:02'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes. Exactly as you mentioned, you need to make compromises between speed\
    \ and quality all the time. [cross-talk] Otherwise, you're just collecting technical\
    \ debt if you just use speed. This dimension of onboarding people \u2013 for me,\
    \ I think that was one of the biggest challenges. You have so many people coming\
    \ in, not just in your team, but as stakeholders. I think for me, it's the two\
    \ biggest things like, \u201CHow do you make compromises all the time?\u201D And\
    \ \u201CHow do you keep your onboarding process smooth?\u201D And also \u201C\
    Is your product ready to scale internally or externally?\u201D"
  sec: 566
  time: '9:26'
  who: Mehdi
- header: Hypergrowth
- line: So, in this case, the hyper growth that you were talking about refers to both
    growth in terms of the user base, also in terms of traffic, consequently, and
    also in terms of the number of people who work at the company. And it all happens
    at the same time, right?
  sec: 621
  time: '10:21'
  who: Alexey.
- line: I mean, it depends. But usually, they want to hire a lot of people because
    they get a lot of users and they have new challenges.
  sec: 636
  time: '10:36'
  who: Mehdi
- line: "What are some of the recent companies that you would describe as scale-ups?\
    \ Maybe you heard about Gorillas \u2013 this is a grocery delivery company. Would\
    \ it be considered a scale-up?"
  sec: 649
  time: '10:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, definitely. In Berlin, there are a lot. I think what I would not call\
    \ scale-up, even if they\u2019re tech companies like Zalando, for example. It's\
    \ more established. Spotify is another example."
  sec: 659
  time: '10:59'
  who: Mehdi
- line: That would be an enterprise, right?
  sec: 671
  time: '11:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. Because they're already rich \u2013 they're still growing, but not\
    \ at the same curve. They have more established revenue which makes them more\
    \ comfortable to survive such a barrier that we have now, for example."
  sec: 672
  time: '11:12'
  who: Mehdi
- line: "Scale-ups typically have investors as well, right? They are not necessarily\
    \ earning all this money \u2013 they usually just closed an investment round,\
    \ so they have borrowed money. So it's necessarily their own."
  sec: 693
  time: '11:33'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, most of the time. I'm not such a huge fan. With what the landscape has
    been like in these past years, we've got huge funding. Was it reasonable or not?
    That's another story. But yeah, usually there is funding. That's what I was saying,
    that we achieved some first revenues. But the value is still yet to be proven.
    That's why basically, you bet on investing into a lot of features and a lot of
    engineers to reach a state where you're comfortable.
  sec: 709
  time: '11:49'
  who: Mehdi
- header: Data platform engineers in a scale-up environment
- line: And what do data engineers do in a scale-up environment? How is this world
    different from your typical enterprise?
  sec: 750
  time: '12:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I would say that we put the landscape in place, so here it is. You're joining\
    \ a team. A data engineering team or a data platform team has multiple consumers\
    \ internally \u2013 data analysts, data scientists \u2013 and let's say you have\
    \ 100 of them today (or maybe way less, like 50) but the growth over the month\
    \ is really big. So aside from the people, you would expect a lot more use cases,\
    \ different ways of using your products as a data platform engineer, so you need\
    \ to think when you build stuff and how you can scale the usability directly and\
    \ remove yourself from the equation."
  sec: 760
  time: '12:40'
  who: Mehdi
- line: "That was mostly my role \u2013 I forget to mention in the intro \u2013 but\
    \ there are multiple definitions of data engineer. But I have been working more\
    \ as a data platform engineer, providing tools and services. Before, I was doing\
    \ more things like writing pipelines and business logic, in order to deliver that\
    \ to other internal data stakeholders. There will still be those kinds of people\
    \ in a scale-up. But it's the same thing \u2013 they need to think about how they\
    \ can scale. Like, \u201COkay, I'm doing a small pipeline that uses a Google sheet.\
    \ It's totally fine for this small use case. But then suddenly that Google sheet\
    \ blows up because there is way more data.\u201D"
  sec: 760
  time: '12:40'
  who: Mehdi
- line: "Giving a certain context, let\u2019s come back to going to the US market,\
    \ for example. So what do you do, right? So that's the thing \u2013 you need to\
    \ anticipate more about the fact that things are going to break way sooner than\
    \ they otherwise would. I would say in a startup, you can be a bit more of a cowboy\
    \ because you can say \u201COkay, let's just have users. Do a shortcut, and maybe\
    \ there is some technical depth down the line that we're going to regret. But\
    \ it's fine. Let's just bring value in and go for it.\u201D And in a scale-up\
    \ environment, it's a bit different. Because if you do the shortcuts without thinking\
    \ too much, it's gonna cost you way sooner than expected."
  sec: 760
  time: '12:40'
  who: Mehdi
- line: "As I understand you, as a data platform engineer (or a data engineer working\
    \ on the data platform) your role is to let others build data pipelines. You build\
    \ tools for that so then the data scientists, data analysts \u2013 whoever needs\
    \ data \u2013 can use this platform to do whatever they need. And you need to\
    \ build it in such a way that it can withstand 10 times more traffic than today."
  sec: 911
  time: '15:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. Coming back to the onboarding thing, I think there is a lot of education\
    \ to do around those different people, because they all come from different backgrounds.\
    \ I guess the data roles in general \u2013 the names \u2013 they're super confusing,\
    \ right? Data scientists, analytics engineers\u2026 How deep is the technical\
    \ knowledge of the person? Does he have experience with that technology or that\
    \ one? So your job as a data platform engineer is also really to make it as simple\
    \ as possible, so that if you assume a certain technical level of your data consumers,\
    \ it has to be \u201COkay, I think they're going to be able to do that.\u201D\
    \ But not that much and it has to be pretty well-documented."
  sec: 940
  time: '15:40'
  who: Mehdi
- line: "You may have an onboarding session, a support channel that is reactive, that\
    \ listens to the user. So it's really kind of like a startup inside a scale-up\
    \ where you really need to listen closely to your consumer, because they're growing\
    \ quickly. If you just behave like, \u201COkay, I'm gonna do that pipeline myself\
    \ because it's faster.\u201D Like you could do, for example, in other companies\
    \ \u2013 you will regret it down the line because you're still putting yourself\
    \ in the equation as a dependency. Here, it's really about leveraging other data\
    \ people."
  sec: 940
  time: '15:40'
  who: Mehdi
- header: What a data platform is and who builds it
- line: In practical terms, what does having a data platform usually mean? Is it like
    an Airflow cluster and then some other things that you can use from this Airflow
    cluster? Or what?
  sec: 1042
  time: '17:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I think it's more than that, definitely, because that\u2019s just one piece.\
    \ It's like having a car without a driver\u2019s license. [chuckles] You cannot\
    \ do much. I mean, you could \u2013 but then things are probably gonna break.\
    \ [cross-talk]"
  sec: 1054
  time: '17:34'
  who: Mehdi
- line: "So Airflow is the car, right? What is the driver\u2019s license then?"
  sec: 1072
  time: '17:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: "The driving license probably would be, for example how you should structure\
    \ the thing, how you should handle sequence in Airflow \u2013 what's the naming\
    \ convention? Maybe also configure some Airflow pipelines as a YAML file, if they're\
    \ generic, rather than having to rewrite them all in all. Again, this is a classic\
    \ thing where you take an Airflow DAG, \u201CYeah, it's okay. We can do it manually\
    \ and copy/paste. They are slightly different. We are not going into the struggle\
    \ of having a YAML file that generates DAGs.\u201D There are easy frameworks,\
    \ by the way, to help you do so."
  sec: 1076
  time: '17:56'
  who: Mehdi
- line: "But the point is, again, you need to think ahead and say, \u201COkay, are\
    \ we going to have 10 pipelines like this? Or 20 pipelines next month like this?\
    \ Maybe we should better invest that time now.\u201D It's always about compromise.\
    \ To come back to your question, the driving license is basically all the best\
    \ practices that you can put from the start so that things do not go bananas and\
    \ become hard to control. That's usually the case \u2013 if you have a lot of\
    \ users, they have so much imagination that at the end, you end up with a lot\
    \ of interesting things on your platform."
  sec: 1076
  time: '17:56'
  who: Mehdi
- line: "So in some ways, the data platform is the car, the car park is Airflow plus\
    \ I guess some connections maybe to databases, data lakes, and so on, so you can\
    \ read from somewhere, write to some other place. Then, in addition to that, you\
    \ have a set of rules or a playbook or something that people can use in order\
    \ to effectively use the Airflow part \u2013 the car park \u2013 so they can drive\
    \ the car."
  sec: 1165
  time: '19:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: You, as a data engineer, need to make sure that, first of all, these things
    are up to date and users know how to use it. I guess you also help them figure
    out how exactly they should use it.
  sec: 1165
  time: '19:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah, that's exactly it. Yeah.
  sec: 1209
  time: '20:09'
  who: Mehdi
- line: Okay. And who do we need to actually build this thing? This type of data platform?
  sec: 1213
  time: '20:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, I think I can tell you about some mistakes in the past. For a scale-up,\
    \ you probably don't want to compromise on seniority. You know, there is this\
    \ saying, \u201CIf you pay peanuts, you get a monkey.\u201D [chuckles] The point\
    \ is, you should try to recruit a lot of senior folks first to set those best\
    \ practices. You don't need a ton of them, but if you are just relying on juniors\
    \ or new folks who are starting their career to set up things that scale at a\
    \ huge fast pace, it will be really difficult. The problem is that learning on\
    \ the job is really challenging, because the challenges fall down on your desk.\
    \ It's like, \u201COkay, now we're going to the US, so you need to scale this.\u201D\
    \ \u201CIt's not just \u201COkay, what if we build that feature?\u201D No. It's\
    \ happening next month. [chuckles] Also, you\u2019re trying to get people with\
    \ niche skills, if you need."
  sec: 1220
  time: '20:20'
  who: Mehdi
- line: "Again, it's the same reason \u2013 because it's really difficult to ramp\
    \ up on certain technology. Let's say you have a use case with streaming, and\
    \ you need to implement a Kafka cluster. Don't expect people that have never worked\
    \ with Kafka, even if they're brilliant engineers, to just learn by themselves\
    \ and set up the thing to scale up. Even if it's temporary, hire an expert in\
    \ that \u2013 someone who has huge security. Same if you go into the cloud. Most\
    \ companies are already in the cloud, or if you are changing a cloud provider,\
    \ just get someone that has experience with that and that will help to put the\
    \ best practices in place."
  sec: 1220
  time: '20:20'
  who: Mehdi
- line: "I mean, even you and me, we're both experienced in the domain, but whenever\
    \ we tackle a new technology, it's always super hard to say, \u201CIs it the right\
    \ way to use it?\u201D There is a value in experience of having to work before\
    \ with the technology if you need to scale it fast. Yeah."
  sec: 1220
  time: '20:20'
  who: Mehdi
- line: "You mentioned \u201CWe need a Kafka cluster.\u201D But if we don't have experience\
    \ using Kafka, how do we know that we actually need it? It would be funny to have\
    \ to hire a person who has this experience with Kafka only for them to start working\
    \ and say, \u201CHey, we shouldn't use Kafka here.\u201D"
  sec: 1368
  time: '22:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: '[chuckles] Yeah, no. That''s fairly true. There is an architecture decision
    that should also be driven by some senior people. But I think [cross-talk]'
  sec: 1389
  time: '23:09'
  who: Mehdi
- line: "So you need somebody like that, too, when you\u2019re designing the platform."
  sec: 1400
  time: '23:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. But the point is also at the lower level, let's say you have an engineer\
    \ or software engineer that's comfortable with that subsystem, maybe RabbitMQ,\
    \ and they want to consider Kafka. Some of them have heard of it, some of them\
    \ have been playing a bit \u2013 they consume the Kafka topic. But the point is,\
    \ just having high level knowledge on this to possibly make some decision, and\
    \ even some good decision, is not enough to say, \u201COkay, now we're going to\
    \ implement it and serve it at scale. We have a team and we're going to maintain\
    \ it,\u201D right? That's a huge difference."
  sec: 1406
  time: '23:26'
  who: Mehdi
- line: "The point is that you're going to start with one or two topics to try it\
    \ out and then the next round, you're probably going to have 15. By the end of\
    \ three months, you're going to have hundreds of topics. And if you didn't have\
    \ the Kafka expert at the beginning, then it's really hard to untie everything.\
    \ A concrete example I can give you \u2013 I was mentioning Kafka just off the\
    \ top of my head. But for data folks, it's a data contract with users \u2013 or\
    \ a software engineer pushes data to Kafka and they have used it from service\
    \ to service, as a Pub/Sub. And they often really don\u2019t care about what's\
    \ happening downstream. Then, the data team is going to apply to Kafka downstream\
    \ to S3 and then the transformation."
  sec: 1406
  time: '23:26'
  who: Mehdi
- line: "One best practice to do in that sense is to actually put some data contracts\
    \ in place with the data folks and say, \u201COkay, this is the schema that we're\
    \ going to have. Everything is going to be typed. So we are not going to put random\
    \ JSON. It\u2019s gonna be Avro, for example on the schema registry. You can consult\
    \ the latest version. If there is a change in the schema, this is what we're going\
    \ to allow to change. This is our process for changing the schema.\u201D As a\
    \ whole those things will go smoothly for the things down the line, because then\
    \ if you have a new user of Kafka, you just read the guideline and that's it.\
    \ But if there is no guideline, again, people are really creative. [chuckles]"
  sec: 1406
  time: '23:26'
  who: Mehdi
- line: "In the end, you\u2019re just suffering, consuming that stuff. Whereas the\
    \ data platform team can say, \u201COh, there is a data type change in that schema.\
    \ That was allowed.\u201D Or \u201CThere is not even a proper schema, it's just\
    \ a JSON that's evolving. It's really hard to parse. We have iCompute cost on\
    \ our Spark cluster or data warehouse, because the data is not super well-modeled\
    \ from the source.\u201D So basically, it's just a few examples that create a\
    \ lot of downstream problems that you could have avoided with some best practices\
    \ from the start."
  sec: 1406
  time: '23:26'
  who: Mehdi
- line: "So I guess if you don't have experience in Kafka, then you might not know\
    \ that schemas change, or you might not realize it and just say, \u201COkay, I'll\
    \ just be sending JSON. What can possibly go wrong?\u201D But then in a couple\
    \ of months, something happens, the data changes, and you just didn't think about\
    \ this. The person who had experienced this \u2013 who probably lived through\
    \ this experience of having to somehow manage this ever-changing JSON files (perhaps\
    \ maybe you had this experience) that's why you're bringing this up, right? [chuckles]"
  sec: 1575
  time: '26:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yeah. [laughs] Definitely. It was a pain.
  sec: 1612
  time: '26:52'
  who: Mehdi

    \ In the context of a scale-up, I would say 50/50, because you're gonna build\
    \ as many pipelines as features that you develop in order to ease the development\
    \ of the pipeline. [chuckles] There are going to be a lot of requests that are\
    \ similar, basically. You need to build frameworks \u2013 to build something generic\
    \ around it, so that's more of the data platform work. But yes, I would say 50/50,\

    \ solving problems for your team and as a senior, you're stepping back and looking\
    \ at what the closest team is doing in terms of the data platform or users. Both\
    \ teams have projects, so you start thinking about what you need to do in order\
    \ to help two teams, for example, your team and another one. It's the same thing\
    \ for staff. When you get staff, it's more about the whole engineering scope,\
    \ \u201COkay, how do I have a project that solves issues that are present for\
    \ all the engineering teams?\u201D"

    \ problem?\u201D Go talk with people from other teams, book a chat. I think it's\
    \ way harder now, for me at least. Before I would just go to the coffee machine\
    \ and learn stuff. But book intentionally and say, \u201CHey, I just want to chat\
    \ informally about what you\u2019ve been up to.\u201D And maybe you're going to\

    \ to produce content \u2013 I don't have the flying wheel yet because my expectations\
    \ for production are high. So it's not really a good thing. Because you were mentioning\
