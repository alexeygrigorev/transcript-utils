- line: "The questions for today\u2019s interview were prepared by Johanna Beer. Thanks,\
    \ Johanna! Isabella, let\u2019s start with your career journey. Can you tell us\
    \ about it so far?"

  who: Alexey
- header: Career journey and shift to machine learning
- line: "I have a somewhat unusual background. My first degree was a bachelor\u2019\
    s in biological science, and I always wanted to be a bioinformatician. Luckily,\
    \ my university allowed me to take courses from other departments, so I enrolled\
    \ in computer science classes like data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented\
    \ programming."
  sec: 435
  time: '7:15'
  who: Isabella
- line: "After that, I did a master\u2019s in bioinformatics, where I was introduced\
    \ to machine learning. Around that time, the machine learning boom started, and\
    \ I never looked back. It completely changed my career, and I realized how much\
    \ I loved it."
  sec: 435
  time: '7:15'
  who: Isabella
- line: So, was your shift to machine learning intentional, or was it more of a coincidence?
  sec: 499
  time: '8:19'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It was a mix. I always liked data and thought I\u2019d become more of a data\
    \ engineer. Statistics was my gateway into machine learning. Once I understood\
    \ distributions and linear modeling, it naturally led to functions and, eventually,\
    \ advanced techniques like transformers."
  sec: 509
  time: '8:29'
  who: Isabella
- line: I was in the right place at the right time and fell in love with it. If I
    had started with a passion for machine learning, it might have felt overwhelming.

  sec: 589
  time: '9:49'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, I learned French before moving to France. I wouldn't have dared to move\
    \ without speaking the language\u2014it\u2019s very hard."
  sec: 592
  time: '9:52'
  who: Isabella
- line: "Especially if it\u2019s not Paris. I lived in a small city in France, and\
    \ it\u2019s very difficult to get by with just English."
  sec: 597
  time: '9:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I used to live in Marseille, and it\u2019s different because it\u2019s such\
    \ a tourist hub. You\u2019d hear people speaking Arabic, English, and German on\
    \ the streets, especially in the summer. It could get a bit crazy when cruise\
    \ ships docked, and the city would fill up with tourists. I remember not being\
    \ able to find water in the supermarkets because the city wasn\u2019t equipped\
    \ to handle the influx."
  sec: 608
  time: '10:08'
  who: Isabella
- line: Marseille is unique in that sense, but when it comes to administrative work,
    you really need to speak French.

  who: Isabella
- line: "We also noticed on your LinkedIn profile that you\u2019ve done several internships\
    \ while studying, including one at INRIA, which is quite well known. I\u2019m\
    \ familiar with them because I started there. What did you work on at INRIA? And\
    \ can you explain what INRIA is?"
  sec: 643
  time: '10:43'
  who: Alexey
- header: Internship at INRIA and working on cancer research
- line: INRIA is a French research institute. Its full name translates to the National
    Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology. They originally focused
    on automation, but that term has evolved to mean AI in their context.
  sec: 674
  time: '11:14'
  who: Isabella
- line: "Before starting my internship, I didn\u2019t know much about INRIA. I learned\
    \ just a week prior that they were involved in projects like Scikit-learn, which\
    \ made me feel a lot of pressure\u2014I realized I was joining a big name."
  sec: 674
  time: '11:14'
  who: Isabella
- line: "I got the internship through a career development module in my master\u2019\
    s program. They invited professionals to share their career paths, and a researcher\
    \ named Sebastian gave a talk. He was a mathematician who applied his expertise\
    \ to biomarkers and cancer research. I had done my bachelor\u2019s thesis on biomarkers,\
    \ so I reached out to him afterward, expressing interest in his work. He invited\
    \ me to do an internship, and I worked with his team for two months."
  sec: 674
  time: '11:14'
  who: Isabella
- line: "We developed models to predict patient responses to immunotherapy for a specific\
    \ type of lung cancer, using just a simple blood draw. It was an incredible experience\
    \ because I was part of a small, collaborative team. We worked in an open space,\
    \ so if I had a question while coding, I could ask someone and get immediate feedback.\
    \ It was enriching and rewarding, and I\u2019m still friends with some of the\
    \ people I met there."

  who: Isabella
- line: Is INRIA based in Paris?
  sec: 810
  time: '13:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, the team I worked with had recently moved to Marseille. Originally, they
    were based in Bordeaux, which is on the coast.
  sec: 811
  time: '13:31'
  who: Isabella
- line: "I\u2019m not sure where Bordeaux is."
  sec: 826
  time: '13:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Think of France as a hexagon. Bordeaux is on the lower left corner, near the
    Atlantic coast.
  sec: 829
  time: '13:49'
  who: Isabella
- line: "I\u2019ve heard of Bordeaux but haven\u2019t been there. Even though I lived\
    \ in France, I only know the places I visited. Does INRIA focus exclusively on\
    \ machine learning and AI?"
  sec: 840
  time: '14:00'
  who: Alexey
- header: AI research and the role of INRIA in AI and machine learning
- line: "No, they also conduct statistical and foundational research. However, they\u2019\
    ve gained a lot of recognition in AI and machine learning because they\u2019re\
    \ at the forefront of the field. For instance, they co-published research on algorithms\
    \ like SPAtting or SPlaTting\u2014I can never remember the exact name."
  sec: 865
  time: '14:25'
  who: Isabella
- line: France has been heavily investing in AI innovation, and INRIA benefits from
    that. The government is very supportive of AI research.
  sec: 865
  time: '14:25'
  who: Isabella
- line: "When I think about AI in France, I think of companies like Mistral. It seems\
    \ like France has become a hub for AI innovation. In contrast, there aren\u2019\
    t many similar companies in Germany."
  sec: 898
  time: '14:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: "That\u2019s partly because President Macron has been very proactive about\
    \ promoting AI. France has several prominent companies, like Mistral, Hugging\
    \ Face, and startups like JustCallToo, which focuses on evaluating large language\
    \ models. Paris is definitely becoming an AI hub."

    \ learning engineer. What are you working on?"
  sec: 943
  time: '15:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I\u2019m working full-time as a freelancer. I can\u2019t disclose the company\
    \ I\u2019m working with due to an NDA, but I\u2019m building a recommendation\
    \ system. Specifically, I\u2019m automating the process of generating knowledge\
    \ graphs for a company, which has direct applications in insurance."
  sec: 955
  time: '15:55'
  who: Isabella
- line: "It\u2019s quite different from what I\u2019ve done in the past, but I\u2019\
    ve been wanting to freelance full-time for a while, so I jumped at the opportunity\
    \ when it came."
  sec: 955

  sec: 994
  time: '16:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, but I\u2019ve done freelancing before, mainly as a data scientist."
  sec: 1000
  time: '16:40'
  who: Isabella
- line: "So, you\u2019ve been freelancing for a while, but now your focus has shifted.\
    \ What did you do as a data scientist before?"
  sec: 1005
  time: '16:45'
  who: Alexey
- header: Transition from research to freelancing
- line: Before this, I worked on a project for a company that involved aggregating
    and processing georeferenced open-source data. Sometimes we used machine learning,
    but other times it was more rule-based, using classical database merging systems.
    The goal was to generate maps for specific regions of interest. It was very data-focused,
    unlike my current role, which is more model-focused.
  sec: 1017
  time: '16:57'
  who: Isabella
- line: Did you start your career as a freelancer?
  sec: 1058
  time: '17:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: "No, I began in a research-based position. I wanted to gain research experience,\
    \ but I realized it wasn\u2019t for me."
  sec: 1060
  time: '17:40'
  who: Isabella
- line: "Research is fascinating when you see the final papers and results, but on\
    \ a day-to-day basis, I found it unsatisfying. I prefer engineering, where I can\
    \ work toward a clear deliverable or final product. Freelancing allows me to balance\
    \ both aspects\u2014engineering and a bit of research."
  sec: 1060
  time: '17:40'
  who: Isabella
- line: Did you pursue a PhD while working as a researcher?
  sec: 1120
  time: '18:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I started a PhD but decided it wasn\u2019t for me."
  sec: 1132
  time: '18:52'
  who: Isabella
- line: So, after deciding against a PhD, you transitioned to freelancing instead
    of joining a company as a full-time employee. Why?
  sec: 1137
  time: '18:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I wasn\u2019t sure what I wanted to do at first, so freelancing gave me the\
    \ opportunity to explore. With freelancing, you change projects often, meet new\
    \ people, and experience how different companies operate. That variety and hands-on\
    \ experience were exactly what I wanted."
  sec: 1160
  time: '19:20'
  who: Isabella
- line: "Freelancing seems more challenging because you need to find clients, and\
    \ companies usually expect a certain level of experience from freelancers. Wouldn\u2019\
    t it have been easier to get a full-time job first? It feels like freelancing\
    \ is a harder path, but you skipped the traditional route entirely. That\u2019\
    s quite interesting."
  sec: 1188
  time: '19:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: It was a bit stressful to be a freelancer. Sometimes you need to actively
    look for clients, find offers, and contact people. However, I don't think it's
    as difficult as people make it out to be. It's just a different skill set. Looking
    for a traditional job can also be quite challenging.
  sec: 1238
  time: '20:38'
  who: Isabella
- line: Eventually, I want to have a full-time job in a company, but only after gaining
    more hands-on experience. For now, freelancing works well for me because I enjoy
    working on different projects and exploring various topics. Being a freelancer
    allows you to focus on what you can immediately offer a company, and if you like
    learning new technologies, it's a great way to stay up to date. You have the flexibility
    to learn independently and apply new knowledge to your projects right away.
  sec: 1238
  time: '20:38'
  who: Isabella
- header: Finding the first freelance client
- line: That's interesting. How did you find your first client? You were doing a PhD,
    realized it wasn't for you, and decided to try freelancing. What was your first
    step?
  sec: 1327
  time: '22:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: I quit my PhD when I felt it was time. I decided to either look for a job
    or try freelancing. I posted my CV in several places since I was already planning
    to move from Marseille to Lyon.
  sec: 1342
  time: '22:22'
  who: Isabella
- line: One day, while I was at the supermarket, I got a call from someone looking
    for a freelancer. They explained what they needed, and I said yes. A week later,
    I had my first client. It all happened very quickly.
  sec: 1342
  time: '22:22'
  who: Isabella
- line: "That\u2019s an interesting story."
  sec: 1387
  time: '23:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I wish it were more exciting, but it\u2019s pretty straightforward. I optimized\
    \ my LinkedIn profile, posted my CV everywhere, and that was it."
  sec: 1390
  time: '23:10'
  who: Isabella
- line: "In a way, that\u2019s a good thing\u2014it shows that it doesn\u2019t have\
    \ to be overly complicated, right?"
  sec: 1407
  time: '23:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, exactly.
  sec: 1415
  time: '23:35'
  who: Isabella
- line: You also had a strong profile, right?
  sec: 1417
  time: '23:37'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, and I was lucky to have worked on projects outside academia. For example,
    I participated in an AI for Good project coordinated by Antina, which involved
    geospatial technologies. When the client called, I already had relevant experience
    because of that project.
  sec: 1419
  time: '23:39'
  who: Isabella
- line: The same goes for the machine learning part. I had joined a few open-source
    projects to gain more practical experience with machine learning. When the opportunity
    came, I had the skills needed. It was a mix of luck and effort on my part.
  sec: 1419
  time: '23:39'
  who: Isabella
- line: "It sounds like more than just a little effort. Balancing an AI for Good project,\
    \ learning new skills, working in academia, and pursuing a PhD is a lot. Finding\
    \ the time and motivation for all of that takes dedication, doesn\u2019t it?"
  sec: 1483
  time: '24:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It does, but open-source work can be so enjoyable that it doesn\u2019t feel\
    \ like effort. Many projects have incredibly passionate and supportive people.\
    \ That energy keeps you motivated and excited to contribute."
  sec: 1513
  time: '25:13'
  who: Isabella
- line: "In open source, there\u2019s often less pressure compared to academic settings\
    \ or boot camps. Deadlines and expectations are more flexible, and you can approach\
    \ tasks with a sense of playfulness. You experiment, learn, and share ideas, which\
    \ makes the process much more engaging and fun."
  sec: 1513
  time: '25:13'
  who: Isabella
- header: Involvement in open-source projects and community courses
- line: Can you tell us more about these open-source projects? How did you get involved?
  sec: 1585
  time: '26:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: "The first project I got deeply involved in was Hugging Face\u2019s community\
    \ course on computer vision. I stumbled upon it on their Discord server. Someone\
    \ mentioned creating a channel for the project, so I joined. There was a spreadsheet\
    \ for contributors, and I signed up."
  sec: 1590
  time: '26:30'
  who: Isabella
- line: "For the next three months, I spent my evenings writing about computer vision,\
    \ reviewing pull requests, and working with others. I made great friends through\
    \ the course\u2014connections I wouldn\u2019t have otherwise."
  sec: 1590
  time: '26:30'
  who: Isabella
- line: The AI for Good project happened because someone I met through this course
    invited me. That led to more connections and other interesting projects. Once
    you know people with shared passions, ideas naturally flow.
  sec: 1590
  time: '26:30'
  who: Isabella
- line: It sounds like the key takeaway is to be active in communities and open to
    opportunities. You see something that resonates, jump in, and participate.
  sec: 1722
  time: '28:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Exactly. It can feel scary at first, but once you take the initial step,\
    \ you realize it\u2019s manageable."
  sec: 1742
  time: '29:02'
  who: Isabella
- line: Especially with community projects, starting something new can be daunting.
    But working alongside others provides structure. You take one step at a time,
    and it becomes clear what to do next.
  sec: 1755
  time: '29:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Absolutely. In a community, people naturally take on roles. Some focus on\
    \ editing and organizing ideas, while others track deadlines. Personally, I\u2019\
    m not great at deadlines outside of work, so I really appreciate it when someone\
    \ keeps us on schedule."
  sec: 1778

    it was about computer vision.
  sec: 1812
  time: '30:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 1820
  time: '30:20'
  who: Isabella
- line: So, what exactly did you do there? Was it just one of the modules, or did
    you have a broader role?
  sec: 1821
  time: '30:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I worked mostly on the first module, which covered the basics of computer\
    \ vision and image processing\u2014how computers even \"see\" images, and the\
    \ classical techniques used. Later on, I became a reviewer for the course. We\
    \ reviewed many of the other units. The course was structured so that once everyone\
    \ finished their work, they made a pull request. Then, there were a lot of pull\
    \ requests to review, so we would step in when available. I also contributed to\
    \ sections like \"Introduction to Transfer Learning.\" By the time I joined, most\
    \ of the advanced topics were already taken, and the introductory topics were\
    \ still open. So, I worked on one of those."
  sec: 1827
  time: '30:27'
  who: Isabella
- line: How much experience in computer vision did you have at that time?
  sec: 1885
  time: '31:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: When I was working in academia, both my last internship during my master's
    degree and the beginning of my academic career involved computer vision. So, I
    was already quite familiar with it.
  sec: 1889
  time: '31:29'
  who: Isabella
- line: "I'm curious\u2014how deep should your knowledge be to participate in a community\
    \ course like that, so you don't feel like an imposter?"
  sec: 1903
  time: '31:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: That's a great question. I was very comfortable with the topic I worked on,
    but there were definitely people with less experience than me. They did a great
    job, though. Sometimes they would ask, "I don't understand this. Can you recommend
    a paper or a book to help?" Even if they weren't experts in the field, they put
    in the effort to research. And since there was always someone more knowledgeable,
    we were able to guide each other and review each other's work. There were also
    people reviewing the pull requests, which helped catch mistakes or clarify things.
    So, while not all topics are beginner-friendly, I believe there's always a part
    of a project that is.
  sec: 1917
  time: '31:57'
  who: Isabella
- line: Right. And when you're experienced in a topic like computer vision, some things
    might seem obvious to you, and you might not take the time to explain them. But
    someone with a fresh perspective might find it confusing and ask how you transitioned
    from one concept to another.
  sec: 1975
  time: '32:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Exactly. That's one of the things I love about teaching. When you work on
    something every day, you forget that what you find intuitive might not be obvious
    to others. When students ask questions, it makes you realize that not everyone
    has the same level of knowledge. It forces you to slow down and explain things
    more clearly. Also, machine learning has a lot of jargon, and sometimes terms
    are used interchangeably when they don't need to be. For someone starting out,
    it's especially important to break things down simply and clearly.

  who: Isabella
- header: Finding open-source project opportunities
- line: "Let's say I want to find a project to contribute to\u2014perhaps an open-source\
    \ project. Where would you suggest looking for these opportunities? Could it be\
    \ random communities, or are there specific places where people can get involved?"
  sec: 2051
  time: '34:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: Well, first, if you use a specific open-source model or library, they likely
    have a Slack or Discord community. A good place to start is by joining those and
    seeing what others are working on. You can also check out the issues on GitHub.
    Often, there are easy issues to fix. If you're using a library regularly, you
    may spot something that's not optimal, and you could open an issue or propose
    a fix. Just be polite and open about it, and things will work out. Another good
    place is documentation. Sometimes, projects explicitly ask for contributions to
    documentation, which is a great place to start because everyone wants to contribute
    to the code, but no one wants to write documentation. Starting there can give
    you a good experience. On the community side, I think Omten A is a good place
    to look for projects. They organize local chapters where you can get hands-on
    experience with a machine learning project in a low-pressure environment. Training
    is usually provided in these courses, and everyone works together to review a
    couple of notebooks. I think those are two good places to begin.
  sec: 2081
  time: '34:41'
  who: Isabella
- line: "When I think of contributing to open-source, I usually think of tools like\
    \ Scikit-learn, Pandas, or NumPy. When someone says, \"You can contribute to open-source,\"\
    \ I think, \"Okay, I'll go to the GitHub issues for Scikit-learn and fix something.\"\
    \ But now, after hearing you talk about contributing to open-source projects,\
    \ I realize there are different kinds of projects\u2014it's not just about working\
    \ on tools, but using those tools to solve other problems."
  sec: 2204
  time: '36:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Exactly. Open-source has many dimensions. There are open-source codebases,\
    \ open-source data, and open-source tools. Contributing to open-source tools is\
    \ great, but it's also one of the most overwhelming places to start. If you look\
    \ at a big library like NumPy and check out their issues, you\u2019ll often see\
