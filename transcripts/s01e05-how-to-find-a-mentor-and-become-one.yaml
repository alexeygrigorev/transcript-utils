- line: Thank you everyone for coming to today's event. This event is brought to you
    by Data Talks Club, which is a community of people interested in data. We have
    weekly events, and the ones we usually have on Tuesday are more technical and
    include presentations. This week we talked about AWS Glue DataBrew, a new service
    from AWS. We will take a break for a couple of weeks and then next month we will
    talk about model monitoring and a feature store called Feast.

  who: Alexey
- line: We also have live podcast events on Friday like today. These are more like
    discussions, without slides, and they are usually just Q and A. Today the topic
    is mentoring. For this type of event we will also have a break and come back in
    the middle of January with a topic on writing. Then we will talk about a developer
    advocate role and machine learning operations in Europe.

  who: Alexey
- line: If during today you have any questions, please ask them on Slido. Slido is
    a special platform for asking questions. I will now share the link with you in
    the chat, and you can click on it.

  time: '1:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: We can start. Let me pull up my notes.
  sec: 100
  time: '1:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Today the topic is mentoring, and we have a special guest, Rahul Jain. Rahul
    is a technical leader with 20 years of experience in building and running software
    products. He now leads the business intelligence and data engineering units at
    Omio, which is a ticket booking company. Rahul is also a mentor at the Mentoring
    Club, where he offers guidance and coaching to engineers and managers. This is
    why I reached out to him and asked him to share his experience with us.
  sec: 120
  time: '2:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you Rahul for coming today. It is a pleasure to have you.
  sec: 159
  time: '2:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thanks Alexey for having me.
  sec: 165
  time: '2:45'
  who: Rahul
- line: Before we go into the main topic of mentoring, maybe you could tell us a bit
    about your background. Can you tell us about your journey so far?
  sec: 171
  time: '2:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sure. I grew up in India in different parts of northern India, and I graduated
    in 1999 in mining engineering. Not data mining but mining engineering. By the
    time I graduated I was no longer interested in pursuing a career in mining and
    became more interested in computers.
  sec: 177
  time: '2:57'
  who: Rahul
- line: Around that time there was an IT boom, so I took advantage of it and joined
    an Indian IT services company in Bangalore. I was there for about seven years
    as a Java programmer. Back then Java was almost like how Golang and Rust are today,
    the cool thing to do. I learned a lot and worked in different domains as part
    of a consulting company, mostly in finance but also in other areas.
  sec: 190
  time: '3:10'
  who: Rahul
- line: After spending seven years there, I moved to Singapore and joined Credit Suisse,
    an investment bank. That was probably my first experience in the data world because
    most of the products and technologies there were related to data, even though
    we did not call it big data at the time. I was part of a team called Market Data
    Ingest, where I worked on ETLs, although I did not know they were called ETLs
    back then.
  sec: 229
  time: '3:49'
  who: Rahul
- line: I spent six or seven years there, first as a back-end engineer and later as
    a team lead. Then I joined ThoughtWorks, a consulting company with offices around
    the world. They are very popular for deep engineering skills, and Martin Fowler
    is one of their employees. There, again, I worked in different domains but stayed
    close to data.
  sec: 247
  time: '4:07'
  who: Rahul
- line: About three years ago, I moved to Berlin to join Omio, which was called GoEuro
    at the time. We are a ticketing company. If you travel anywhere in Europe and
    now also in the US, you can go to our portal and book your tickets. When I joined,
    I was asked to lead the BI and data engineering team, and that has been my journey
    so far.
  sec: 289
  time: '4:49'
  who: Rahul
- line: It is an interesting experience, especially starting from mining.
  sec: 335
  time: '5:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, absolutely. It is kind of funny because I started with mining and now
    I am doing data mining, even though it is not called data mining anymore. Now
    it is data science.
  sec: 342
  time: '5:42'
  who: Rahul
- line: Today the topic is mentoring, and you are active in this area. You mentor
    people at the Mentoring Club. What does mentoring mean to you?
  sec: 363
  time: '6:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: The traditional definition of mentoring is about having a partnership with
    someone who knows a bit more about a topic than you do. You reach out to them
    and build a supportive relationship, usually to answer questions or get guidance.
    For me, the definition is broader. It is about reaching out to someone for a different
    perspective.
  sec: 376
  time: '6:16'
  who: Rahul
- line: It could be about a problem you are trying to solve, a challenge you are facing,
    or a decision you are trying to make in your career. It is about getting an opinion
    from someone who might have an interesting perspective. In our industry it is
    especially important because we do not have a strong tradition of apprenticeship
    like in food, retail, or law.
  sec: 402
  time: '6:42'
  who: Rahul
- line: For the first few years we rarely work closely with someone who mentors us.
    That is why it is important to have someone to reach out to when navigating challenges.
  sec: 437
  time: '7:17'
  who: Rahul
- line: So for you, mentoring does not necessarily mean a long-term activity. It can
    be reaching out for advice, but it can also be something more formal, like an
    apprenticeship program at a company that lasts for a couple of years.
  sec: 459
  time: '7:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: It depends on your needs. Traditionally, and something I recommend, it is
    good to have a long-term mentoring relationship. But people often have small,
    very specific questions, and it is perfectly fine to reach out and get advice
    in that area too. The definition is not strict. It can be something short or something
    long, depending on what you need.
  sec: 475
  time: '7:55'
  who: Rahul
- line: If I am a Java developer and want to move into data analysis, I can reach
    out to someone and ask whether this is the right path for me. That can also be
    mentoring.
  sec: 491
  time: '8:11'
  who: Rahul
- line: Was mentoring an important part of your career so far?
  sec: 520
  time: '8:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: For the first ten years, no. That is the crazy thing. That is probably why
    I eventually got into mentoring, because I realized how big that gap was. For
    the first ten years I did not have a mentor. I did not even know what mentoring
    meant.
  sec: 528
  time: '8:48'
  who: Rahul
- line: My experience with mentoring, both as a mentor and a mentee, started when
    I joined ThoughtWorks. ThoughtWorks had a strong culture of having a sponsor or
    mentor for every employee. That is how I was introduced to the concept and how
    I started having mentors and mentees.
  sec: 542
  time: '9:02'
  who: Rahul
- line: How does it work? The moment you join, do you get a mentor who stays with
    you throughout your time at the company?
  sec: 565
  time: '9:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: They experiment with different formats, but that is typically how it works.
    You are not always assigned a mentor; you are encouraged to find one yourself.
    If you cannot, the organization or the people team will help you.
  sec: 571
  time: '9:31'
  who: Rahul
- line: The mentor is usually not from your team because the idea is to get mentorship
    from someone who can offer an unbiased opinion about your career. It is advisable
    to have someone who is not your immediate manager, maybe someone from a different
    team.
  sec: 585
  time: '9:45'
  who: Rahul
- line: If you want to find a mentor, it is great when a company has a mentorship
    program. Having someone to talk to about your problems is very useful, especially
    because there are things you do not want to discuss with your manager. How can
    you find such a person?
  sec: 618
  time: '10:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is probably the most difficult part. You want someone who has relevant
    experience and can offer meaningful advice. You also want someone who can actually
    play the role of a mentor. Just because someone knows a topic does not mean they
    are good at mentoring.
  sec: 651
  time: '10:51'
  who: Rahul
- line: It is an iterative process. Rather than spending too much time up front searching
    for the perfect person, you may need to try a few people. You can ask around in
    your network, join a formal mentoring program if your company has one, or use
    your personal connections.
  sec: 663
  time: '11:03'
  who: Rahul
- line: There are also programs like the Mentoring Club, which make finding a mentor
    easier. Some people even reach out directly through LinkedIn to someone they know
    or have heard of and ask if they have time. But it takes a few iterations to find
    the right person.
  sec: 714
  time: '11:54'
  who: Rahul
- line: "You mentioned reaching out to your network. I sometimes get messages like\
    \ \u201CCan you help me with this?\u201D and I often cannot because I do not always\
    \ have the required expertise. Sometimes it feels like people send the same message\
    \ to everyone, hoping someone will respond. I think there is a better way to target\
    \ a message to a specific person. How would you recommend doing this?"
  sec: 745
  time: '12:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is similar to building a relationship. Cold messages are unpredictable
    because the other person does not know you or whether they can help. Investing
    a bit in the relationship first is better. Join a meetup group, participate in
    a Slack community, or engage in discussions. The other person gets to know you
    a bit, and then you can reach out.
  sec: 784
  time: '13:04'
  who: Rahul
- line: If they have seen how you work or participate, they may be more open to the
    conversation. But I would also say do not be afraid to reach out if you have a
    good reason. Sending a thoughtful, specific message can be effective. And do not
    get discouraged if someone does not reply.
  sec: 809
  time: '13:29'
  who: Rahul
- line: Speaking of messages, sometimes I get cold emails that are really good. How
    should such an email look to increase the chances of getting a response?
  sec: 862
  time: '14:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Being specific helps. If I get a message that says \u201CCan you help me\
    \ with something?\u201D, I do not know whether I can help. It is more useful when\
    \ someone explains who they are, what they are struggling with, and what they\
    \ have already tried. Showing authenticity and effort makes a big difference."
  sec: 902
  time: '15:02'
  who: Rahul
- line: Sharing a bit about your background and explaining how you are navigating
    the challenge can also help.
  sec: 938
  time: '15:38'
  who: Rahul
- line: This experience as a mentee at ThoughtWorks at some point you also became
    a mentor yourself, right? First, you were a mentee, someone was helping you, but
    you spent quite a while there. At some point, you had enough experience to actually
    mentor somebody. What did this do to your career? Was it helpful at all, and what
    were the benefits for you as a mentor?
  sec: 957
  time: '15:57'
  who: Alexey
- line: There are quite a few benefits that I have seen over the last few years. First
    and foremost, just being able to help someone or share your experiences is a reward
    in itself because it is a way of giving back. I also felt it made me a better
    listener because you have to listen a lot.
  sec: 981
  time: '16:21'
  who: Rahul
- line: As a team lead, I lead a team, so mentoring also gives me perspective on leading
    a team and what that means. For example, if someone comes with a problem, I can
    relate that to my own experiences with my team. Finally, it has expanded my network.
    Being part of the Mentoring Club, I am connecting with other mentors, which is
    rewarding.
  sec: 1025
  time: '17:05'
  who: Rahul
- line: If somebody reaches out to you on a topic where you do not have experience,
    what do you usually do in that case?
  sec: 1078
  time: '17:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is simple. I just say I do not know and cannot help in that area, and then
    try to connect them with somebody who might be able to help.
  sec: 1084
  time: '18:04'
  who: Rahul
- line: Have you ever been in a situation where you did not know how to solve a problem
    but just by listening and asking questions, you were able to help them?
  sec: 1140
  time: '19:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes, I always try to do that. Quite often, someone reaches out from marketing
    or even construction. Initially, it feels like there is not much overlap, but
    giving a listening ear itself is part of mentorship. Often, by talking, people
    can solve their own problems.
  sec: 1152
  time: '19:12'
  who: Rahul
- line: Also, you can recognize common patterns. Even if they come from a different
    background, many social problems in the workplace are common. You can relate and
    say, "This is similar to what I have seen, here is what I did," and start connecting
    dots between different worlds.
  sec: 1192
  time: '19:52'
  who: Rahul
- line: These people from construction or other industries, did they find you through
    the Mentoring Club?
  sec: 1229
  time: '20:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: Yes.
  sec: 1241
  time: '20:41'
  who: Rahul
- line: Can you tell us a bit more about this club?
  sec: 1251
  time: '20:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'It was started earlier this year by a few colleagues in Berlin. The motivation
    was simple: to reach out to people who need career mentorship or coaching. It
    is grown to almost 300 mentors. I do not have exact numbers, but we have given
    close to a thousand sessions. It is completely free. You just book a session with
    a mentor.'
  sec: 1258
  time: '20:58'
  who: Rahul
- line: Mentors come from all walks of life. There are CXOs, people from product,
    tech, marketing, sales, design, entrepreneurs, and lots of different backgrounds.
  sec: 1301
  time: '21:41'
  who: Rahul
- line: Which topics do you help with on this platform?
  sec: 1327
  time: '22:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: I help with career navigation, challenges at work, career decisions, switching
    careers, or deciding on higher education. I also talk about technical topics like
    data engineering stacks for startups. It varies.
  sec: 1335
  time: '22:15'
  who: Rahul
- line: If someone wants advice and wants to reach out to you through the Mentoring
    Club, how should they best prepare to get the most out of the session?
  sec: 1370
  time: '22:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: It depends on what you are looking for. If you have specific challenges, reach
    out to your mentor first and give as much detail as possible about your background
    and goals. Do a bit of introspection. Are you looking for a one-off session, validation
    of a decision, or a long-term engagement?
  sec: 1384
  time: '23:04'
  who: Rahul
- line: Do not over-prepare. It is not a job interview. Share the details and let
    the conversation flow. One misconception is expecting a specific answer. Mentoring
    is about pointers, planting seeds, probing deeper. It is a process.
  sec: 1442
  time: '24:02'
  who: Rahul
- line: Can you share an example from a recent session? What kind of problems do people
    approach you with?
  sec: 1503
  time: '25:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Some common areas. Imposter syndrome affects more than 50 to 60 percent of
    people who reach out. They feel they are not good enough. I also get questions
    about tech versus management, especially for people with five or six years in
    technology now being asked to take leadership roles. Other questions include career
    moves, whether to join a company or pursue higher education.
  sec: 1517
  time: '25:17'
  who: Rahul
- line: If someone comes to you with imposter syndrome, what do you usually recommend?
  sec: 1575
  time: '26:15'
  who: Alexey
- line: There is no one answer. Imposter syndrome can happen for various reasons.
    I usually go deeper into the root cause. Often it is a perception built by external
    or internal factors. The process is to scratch the surface, question beliefs,
    and help define the problem more specifically.
  sec: 1587
  time: '26:27'
  who: Rahul
- line: It seems to me that to be a good mentor, you really need to understand people
    and go deep to find the root cause. How do you learn that as a tech person, like
    a Java developer?
  sec: 1650
  time: '27:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: It helps to have a natural inclination to help people, which most people do.
    Early in your career, you spend energy as an individual contributor, but even
    then you help new team members onboard. Tech and data work are social activities,
    so you inadvertently develop people skills. You just need to hone them for mentoring.
  sec: 1682
  time: '28:02'
  who: Rahul
- line: "Some aspects, like being a better listener or avoiding the \u201Cadvice monster,\u201D\
    \ jumping immediately into giving advice, are learned over time. Mentoring is\
    \ a skill that comes with practice, and you are likely already doing some of it\
    \ at work."
  sec: 1755
  time: '29:15'
  who: Rahul
- line: So basically, do not be afraid of trying. It is not as difficult as it sounds.
  sec: 1796
  time: '29:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: No, not at all. It is very rewarding. It is not about sitting on a higher
    pedestal. It is about listening and helping others.
  sec: 1801
  time: '30:01'
  who: Rahul
- line: What are the main motivations for a mentor to mentor someone? You mentioned
    helping personally, seeing patterns, becoming a better listener, and the reward
    of helping someone. Is there anything else?
  sec: 1820
  time: '30:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: Those are the main ones. It is also about expanding your perspective and network.
    You learn through mentoring while providing value to others.
  sec: 1840
  time: '30:40'
  who: Rahul
- line: Personally, for me, as I said earlier, for the first ten years I had no one
    to work with. I did not know what I was doing. I came from a mining background.
    There were no engineers or people in software in my family that I could talk to,
    and there was no culture of apprenticeship or mentorship in the first few years
    of my career. I struggled a lot. I did not know if Java was the best thing for
    me. I also went through imposter syndrome for many years.
  sec: 1846
  time: '30:46'
  who: Rahul
- line: For my personality, my motivation came from that experience. Since I did not
    have guidance, I wanted to provide that space for other people. You need to find
    your own motivation, but these were some things that motivated me.
  sec: 1882
  time: '31:22'
  who: Rahul
- line: Through this mentoring club, some people just want a one-time conversation,
    but sometimes people need something more long-term. How often do you have somebody
    who wants long-term mentorship?
  sec: 1903
  time: '31:43'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Long-term mentorship is a little tricky. I have a few people I mentor long-term,\
    \ some from ThoughtWorks and some from the mentoring club. You need to be mindful\
    \ of the mentor\u2019s time investment. Some mentors do it professionally and\
    \ charge a fee."
  sec: 1918
  time: '31:58'
  who: Rahul
- line: Other than that, it is about establishing a clear agreement. If the mentor
    is interested and willing, long-term mentorship is very valuable because it helps
    understand the entire context over time.
  sec: 1970
  time: '32:50'
  who: Rahul
- line: It makes sense to find someone in your workplace for long-term mentorship
    if there is a formal program or someone you can reach out to informally.
  sec: 2004
  time: '33:24'
  who: Rahul
- line: How do you set boundaries for long-term mentorship relationships?
  sec: 2028
  time: '33:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sometimes a paid relationship helps create boundaries and expectations. In
    unpaid long-term mentorship, it is about setting clear expectations. For example,
    tell mentees it is not meaningful to meet unless there is a change in their situation.
    Avoid diminishing returns.
  sec: 2052
  time: '34:12'
  who: Rahul
- line: Being mindful from both sides helps. Ask if the extra session will be beneficial
    before committing.
  sec: 2132
  time: '35:32'
  who: Rahul
- line: What do you think about paid mentoring?
  sec: 2146
  time: '35:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: Paid mentoring can be very beneficial. It can be more constructive and allows
    better expectations. It creates accountability and motivation from both sides.
    It is common for senior leaders but less so for early-career professionals. For
    less experienced people, paid mentorship often focuses on job preparation.
  sec: 2159
  time: '35:59'
  who: Rahul
- line: How can a mentee build a two-way connection with a mentor, not just ask questions?
  sec: 2258
  time: '37:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: Treat it like any relationship. Invest time, be authentic, share challenges,
    strengths, and weaknesses. Conduct retrospectives over time, discuss what is working,
    ask for resources, and make it work for yourself.
  sec: 2270
  time: '37:50'
  who: Rahul
- line: How can people join the mentoring club?
  sec: 2326
  time: '38:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: As a mentee, go to the website, search for a mentor, and book a session through
    Calendly. As a mentor, fill out the enrollment form, and Bastian and Jess will
    review your application.
  sec: 2334
  time: '38:54'
  who: Rahul
- line: Is there a difference mentoring juniors versus more experienced people?
  sec: 2387
  time: '39:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: Not really. It is about the challenges they face and whether you can provide
    meaningful guidance. The problem space may differ, but the approach is similar.
  sec: 2407
  time: '40:07'
  who: Rahul
- line: Should managers be mentors, or is it better to have a separate mentor?
  sec: 2465
  time: '41:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: Managers often have one-on-ones that are somewhat like mentorship but are
    delivery-focused. It is better to seek someone who is not your immediate manager
    for unbiased opinions. You can also have multiple mentors for different areas
    of your career. A mentor shows direction but does not make decisions for you.
  sec: 2483
  time: '41:23'
  who: Rahul
- line: How should someone start being a mentor?
  sec: 2615
  time: '43:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Reach out to your network. Offer mentorship as an option but do not give unsolicited
    advice. You can join formal programs like the Mentoring Club or others like Plato.
    Prepare yourself with empathy, listening, and understanding context differences.
  sec: 2642
  time: '44:02'
  who: Rahul
- line: Some people use mentoring as a side income. What do you think?
  sec: 2718
  time: '45:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: If you provide value, there is nothing wrong with charging money. It helps
    set expectations and boundaries. Some people pursue mentoring full-time successfully.
  sec: 2732
  time: '45:32'
  who: Rahul
- line: What about developers who become mentors and code less over time?
  sec: 2820
  time: '47:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is common when moving into leadership. Mentoring is part of people management.
    It is a myth that you must choose between people management and coding. You can
    balance your time between coding, management, and mentoring according to your
    priorities.
  sec: 2832
  time: '47:12'
  who: Rahul
- line: Any advice for someone who wants to keep coding while managing teams?
  sec: 3012
  time: '50:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: Accept that you can manage your time and mix coding with management. Delegation
    helps create time for coding. The first step is accepting that a balance is possible.
  sec: 3023
  time: '50:23'
  who: Rahul
- line: How can one work on a personal development plan with a manager or mentor?
  sec: 3132
  time: '52:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: It depends on your objectives. Look at the plan regularly with your mentor
    or manager, weekly or monthly. Plans fail when they are created but not revisited.
    The format does not matter as much as the process.
  sec: 3150
  time: '52:30'
  who: Rahul
- line: What do you do when you feel overwhelmed?
  sec: 3258
  time: '54:18'
