transcript:
- line: Hi, welcome everyone. This event is brought to you by DataTalks.Club, a community
    of people who love data. We have two types of events. On Tuesdays, we usually
    have more technical events where we talk about technical topics, usually with
    a presentation with slides, like a webinar.
  sec: 2
  time: 0:02
  who: Alexey
- line: "We will not have many of those in February because we have a conference,\
    \ which I\u2019ll talk more about later. We will come back to these events in\
    \ March, and we already have one planned for March 2nd, about building scalable\
    \ end-to-end data learning pipelines in the cloud. That\u2019s a long title."
  sec: 22
  time: 0:22
  who: Alexey
- line: "We also have a different kind of event, usually on Fridays. Today\u2019s\
    \ event is this type, even though it\u2019s Thursday, where it\u2019s more like\
    \ a conversation. We talk about different things. Today the topic is open source.\
    \ Tomorrow we will talk about envelopes."
  sec: 47
  time: 0:47
  who: Alexey
- line: On February 2nd, which is a Tuesday, we will talk about feature stores. Again
    in February, we will not have many events because of the conference. We will come
    back in March with a topic on public speaking.
  sec: 70
  time: '1:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Regarding the conference, it happens every Friday in February, with four\
    \ tracks each day. First, we will talk about different use cases of machine learning.\
    \ Then we\u2019ll talk about products and processes. After that, we\u2019ll talk\
    \ about careers in data. Finally, we\u2019ll cover machine learning in production."
  sec: 89
  time: '1:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: The link is on our website, datatalks.com, where you can find more information.
    For questions today, we will use Slido. I will share the link now in the chat.
  sec: 120
  time: '2:00'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Here is the link we can use for asking Vincent any questions today. If you\
    \ need to tend to a kid for a brief moment, that\u2019s fine. We will start shortly."
  sec: 149
  time: '2:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Let\u2019s start. Today we\u2019ll talk about open source. We have a special\
    \ guest, Vincent Warmerdam. Vincent works as a Research Advocate at Rasa."
  sec: 189
  time: '3:09'
  who: Alexey
- line: If you check his LinkedIn profile, you will see quite a few things. He has
    been on the front page of Reddit. He is making a resource for people who want
    to learn coding, calmcod.io. He also organized the PyData Amsterdam conference.
  sec: 225
  time: '3:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: "He is a data evangelist and an open source enthusiast. He is a creator and\
    \ maintainer of some open source packages. That\u2019s why we invited him today.\
    \ Last but not least, he has over 80 endorsements for awesomeness on LinkedIn."
  sec: 243
  time: '4:03'
  who: Alexey
- line: Welcome, Vincent. Thanks for coming to our event.
  sec: 265
  time: '4:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Hi. About the endorsements for awesomeness, at a previous company I had a\
    \ bet with a CTO. We played a game to see who could get the most points for awesomeness\
    \ on LinkedIn without asking for them. I might have cheated a little, but it wasn\u2019\
    t about bragging. It was a long-running bet."
  sec: 271
  time: '4:31'
  who: Vincent
- line: "When I was reading your bio on LinkedIn, I thought, \u201COkay, awesomeness,\
    \ let me check.\u201D Of course, even one sentence influences the score."
  sec: 293
  time: '4:53'
  who: Vincent
- line: "Before we get into open source, let\u2019s talk a bit about your background.\
    \ Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your journey so far?"
  sec: 308
  time: '5:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I don\u2019t have a typical background. I was raised bilingually. I was born\
    \ in the United States, lived there for a bit, and did most of my youth in the\
    \ Netherlands, but I traveled to the U.S., which explains my accent. After high\
    \ school, I wanted to study design, which I was keenly interested in."
  sec: 320
  time: '5:20'
  who: Vincent
- line: "I remember getting a bad grade because the feedback was: \u201CVincent, you\u2019\
    re very creative, but you\u2019re not using our 12-step program on brainstorming.\u201D\
    \ I thought, well, I don\u2019t like where this is going. Then I learned about\
    \ econometrics, an applied math field. They promised that I could predict stocks.\
    \ That sounded awesome."
  sec: 344
  time: '5:44'
  who: Vincent
- line: "After the bachelor\u2019s, I found out it\u2019s kind of marketing it doesn\u2019\
    t actually predict stocks. So I quickly decided to take a master\u2019s in operations\
    \ research. Around that time, AI and machine learning were becoming popular. I\
    \ took a free Stanford course with Peter Norvig and Sebastian Thrun, and I realized\
    \ I liked programming more than consulting."
  sec: 373
  time: '6:13'
  who: Vincent
- line: I decided to try a career switch. I backpacked through Latin America with
    a laptop, doing some consulting along the way. I realized I preferred programming
    over going to clubs every night. When I came back to the Netherlands, I taught
    at a business school, but I wanted to focus on data science. A person I met at
    a meetup was starting a Hadoop company and needed someone who understood the math
    behind machine learning.
  sec: 408
  time: '6:48'
  who: Vincent
- line: "I got a gig there, and the ball started rolling. I wanted PyData to happen\
    \ in the Netherlands, so I did some community projects. I\u2019m no longer formally\
    \ involved with PyData, but I\u2019m still around. I had lots of side projects,\
    \ which eventually caught the attention of people at Rasa. They asked me to do\
    \ my Vincent stuff on their stack, because they thought I could help."
  sec: 468
  time: '7:48'
  who: Vincent
- line: "So that\u2019s how you got hired."
  sec: 501
  time: '8:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, it took me a while to realize they wanted to hire me permanently. For\
    \ a long time, I thought it was just a collaborative project. Eventually, they\
    \ said: \u201CWe\u2019re talking about a career here, not a side project.\u201D\
    \ It took me a month to realize that. I\u2019ve been there almost a year, and\
    \ I really enjoy the culture."
  sec: 507
  time: '8:27'
  who: Vincent
- line: "It\u2019s a diverse mix of people. It\u2019s fun, and it\u2019s not just\
    \ about machine learning. One thing I try to pick up is how to work in non-English\
    \ languages. For example, word embeddings trained left-to-right for English don\u2019\
    t work for Arabic. I get to reach out to communities, say here are some tools,\
    \ and get feedback."
  sec: 540
  time: '9:00'
  who: Vincent
- line: "This led to a couple of open source projects, which also led to some articles.\
    \ The main thing I try to do is help people understand tools. Our engineers and\
    \ researchers develop a lot of features, but having a tool is one thing understanding\
    \ it is another. I like teaching, so that\u2019s my focus."
  sec: 575
  time: '9:35'
  who: Vincent
- line: Your title is Research Advocate, right?
  sec: 606
  time: '10:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, that\u2019s the title we came up with."
  sec: 613
  time: '10:13'
  who: Vincent
- line: What are your responsibilities there?
  sec: 618
  time: '10:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It\u2019s hard to explain. The data science field is still figuring out what\
    \ it means to be a data scientist. Six years ago, being a data scientist meant\
    \ figuring it out yourself. It involved a bit of programming, a bit of this, a\
    \ bit of that."
  sec: 623
  time: '10:23'
  who: Vincent
- line: "As a Research Advocate, I\u2019m trying to figure out what it means while\
    \ teaching and helping others. There\u2019s freedom in shaping it myself."
  sec: 653
  time: '10:53'
  who: Vincent
- line: "The thing is, especially with non-English languages, I really like the attitude\
    \ that this job allows me. I do my best to make sure that a lot of these non-English\
    \ tools are well supported in Rasa. I don\u2019t want to give the impression that\
    \ I know everything someone fluent in Arabic knows far more than I ever will."
  sec: 659
  time: '10:59'
  who: Vincent
- line: "A lot of what I do is just listening to people: \u201CHey, you\u2019re trying\
    \ to make this digital assistant work with open source tools. What are your problems?\u201D\
    \ Maybe I can help benchmark something, or I can proxy it to the research team.\
    \ They have really cool tools, and I make sure they\u2019re well understood."
  sec: 678
  time: '11:18'
  who: Vincent
- line: "Sometimes the best thing I can do is make a YouTube video or a blog post.\
    \ Sometimes it\u2019s contributing to open source tools. That\u2019s the ground\
    \ I\u2019m trying to cover. It\u2019s a little bit of improvisation, but it\u2019\
    s good improvisation because I don\u2019t have to pretend I know everything."
  sec: 702
  time: '11:42'
  who: Vincent
- line: "Sometimes, as a consultant, you\u2019re supposed to be the authority all\
    \ the time. Here, I can just say: \u201CLook, if you want to make a virtual assistant\
    \ in any language community, tell me what I need to do, and I\u2019ll gladly help.\u201D\
    \ That\u2019s my main focus."
  sec: 722
  time: '12:02'
  who: Vincent
- line: "So basically, you\u2019re someone between the technical team and the user?"
  sec: 748
  time: '12:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, it\u2019s like a developer advocate with more focus toward research.\
    \ I\u2019ve actually written a research paper by accident this year. I made an\
    \ open source package that\u2019s super useful to some researchers. I make a lot\
    \ of byproducts, which are useful to the community."
  sec: 754
  time: '12:34'
  who: Vincent
- line: "Some of these are machine learning debugging tools that work on top of Rasa.\
    \ Others help explore word embeddings or investigate bias in them. These aren\u2019\
    t core to what we do, but they help our community, which is great."
  sec: 777
  time: '12:57'
  who: Vincent
- line: "Can you explain a bit about the company, Rasa, and what you\u2019re developing?"
  sec: 796
  time: '13:16'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It\u2019s a little different. Elasticsearch helps with search, but the company\
    \ isn\u2019t implementing it for everyone directly. They have support contracts."
  sec: 802
  time: '13:22'
  who: Vincent
- line: "On our side, we help companies make virtual assistants, but we focus on building\
    \ the infrastructure. We provide the standard pipeline for a virtual assistant.\
    \ If you need a very specific component, you can make that. We\u2019re trying\
    \ to provide the infrastructure layer."
  sec: 818
  time: '13:38'
  who: Vincent
- line: "We aim to make it open source and pragmatic, so you can work with it. For\
    \ example, you might want to host it on your own servers for healthcare applications.\
    \ We provide the tools to do this in an open source way. It\u2019s as simple as\
    \ a pip install."
  sec: 837
  time: '13:57'
  who: Vincent
- line: Speaking of open source, what does open source mean to you?
  sec: 862
  time: '14:22'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I have to admit, I don\u2019t consider myself super knowledgeable about all\
    \ the details, like licenses. Some people take licenses very seriously. My approach\
    \ has always been pragmatic: people made a bag of tools and tricks that are useful\
    \ to me. I sometimes create my own tricks that others might not have made."
  sec: 870
  time: '14:30'
  who: Vincent
- line: The best example is Psychic Lego, which I started with Matias from PyData
    Amsterdam. Some tools, like SciKit-Learn, are amazing, but there are tricks I
    use often that are experimental. I host those myself.
  sec: 906
  time: '15:06'
  who: Vincent
- line: "This is how I approach open source: I scratch an itch, and others can find\
    \ edge cases and help improve the code. That wouldn\u2019t happen if I kept it\
    \ private."
  sec: 939
  time: '15:39'
  who: Vincent
- line: "So everything on GitHub is automatically open source, as long as it\u2019\
    s not private?"
  sec: 956
  time: '15:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes, but I make a distinction. I have an open source project called Brent\
    \ that I put on PyPI, but it\u2019s not fully ready. There are edge cases that\
    \ need to be fixed before it\u2019s fully public. Hosting on GitHub is fine, but\
    \ there\u2019s a maturity step before publishing to a public package index."
  sec: 962
  time: '16:02'
  who: Vincent
- line: You mentioned Psychic Lego and Brent. Can you tell us more about them?
  sec: 1004
  time: '16:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Open source often starts with curiosity: I want to explore an idea or improve\
    \ a user interface. For example, the library EVIL is an evolutionary algorithm\
    \ library. The name is an anagram of \u201Clove evil.\u201D"
  sec: 1022
  time: '17:02'
  who: Vincent
- line: I made EVIL with GoHere. We wanted to simplify genetic algorithms, which are
    usually a for-loop inside a for-loop inside a for-loop. We created a population
    object and an evolution object with a functional API. This makes evolutionary
    algorithms easier to use.
  sec: 1063
  time: '17:43'
  who: Vincent
- line: "I haven\u2019t touched the library in years, but it still gets a few hundred\
    \ downloads a week. People blog about it because the API is simpler. Another library\
    \ is Clumper, like pandas but for nested JSON objects, to make the API easier."
  sec: 1092
  time: '18:12'
  who: Vincent
- line: "Memo is another tool, a set of decorators that log function outputs. If you\u2019\
    re doing grid search, Memo saves everything in a JSON file. That\u2019s one branch\
    \ of packages I make: improving usability."
  sec: 1119
  time: '18:39'
  who: Vincent
- line: "The other branch integrates with existing ecosystems. For scikit-learn, I\
    \ made Psychic Lego, HumanLearn, and other tools. HumanLearn allows rule-based\
    \ systems so domain experts can use \u201Cif this, then that.\u201D"
  sec: 1137
  time: '18:57'
  who: Vincent
- line: "I also made WhatLies, which investigates word embeddings. It\u2019s pipeline-compatible\
    \ with Psychic Learn, so you can benchmark models quickly. You can check if a\
    \ slower model is actually more accurate."
  sec: 1162
  time: '19:22'
  who: Vincent
- line: You mentioned quite a few packages there were at least ten you listed.
  sec: 1207
  time: '20:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I also do lots of stuff for Rasa, but that\u2019s my employer, so that\u2019\
    s cheating. I write my packages so they don\u2019t require a lot of maintenance.\
    \ For example, I have one called ScheduleLord, which helps me maintain my cron\
    \ jobs on my Raspberry Pis. It has documentation, but in reality, it has five\
    \ users, and that\u2019s fine."
  sec: 1224
  time: '20:24'
  who: Vincent
- line: "I also have another tool called MakeTestDocs. It\u2019s a package with two\
    \ functions that make it easier to write unit tests for your markdown files. If\
    \ you have Python examples in your README or MakeDocs template, you can just add\
    \ one or two functions, and your documentation becomes your unit test. It\u2019\
    s easy to maintain two functions."
  sec: 1255
  time: '20:55'
  who: Vincent
- line: "What caught my attention was the names of your packages. They\u2019re very\
    \ creative. How do you pick names for your projects?"
  sec: 1286
  time: '21:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: "My approach is pretty silly. A while ago, a buddy and I made a website called\
    \ MakeNames.io. The idea is to use Pok\xE9mon names as a training dataset to generate\
    \ new names. We also used the IKEA catalog as a corpus. It\u2019s not meant to\
    \ be a serious project."
  sec: 1297
  time: '21:37'
  who: Vincent
- line: "Usually, I spend ten minutes generating names. If I get frustrated because\
    \ they\u2019re silly, I turn that into a sentence describing what the package\
    \ does. For example, Psychic Lego is for building Lego-like blocks in a scikit-learn\
    \ pipeline. HumanLearn lets humans put rules into scikit-learn. WhatLies investigates\
    \ word embeddings. Clumper helps JSON clump together. Memo helps memorize stuff."
  sec: 1334
  time: '22:14'
  who: Vincent
- line: Naming is often the hardest part. In a past career, I did consultancy for
    the Dutch Flower Auction. The team culture was great because we named every new
    service. For example, a SQL database service was called Steven Sequal. When we
    upgraded it, we called it Steven C. Call the Sequel. A document store was called
    Jason Bourne.
  sec: 1387
  time: '23:07'
  who: Vincent
- line: This silly naming competition made every service launch exciting. Communication
    improved because the names clearly described what the server should do.
  sec: 1425
  time: '23:45'
  who: Vincent
- line: So for Psychic Lego, the name reflects building blocks that can be combined
    into a pipeline?
  sec: 1505
  time: '25:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Yes. It\u2019s a scikit-learn-compatible pipeline component. Some are fancy,\
    \ some are simple. For example, if you train a model and get an outlier during\
    \ prediction, we have a component to clip it. It might not be useful for everyone,\
    \ but it\u2019s ready if someone needs it."
  sec: 1517
  time: '25:17'
  who: Vincent
- line: We also have meta-components. For instance, a classifier might use a threshold
    of 0.5. You could grid search to find a threshold that optimizes precision or
    recall. These tools help you investigate and adjust the model.
  sec: 1552
  time: '25:52'
  who: Vincent
- line: "We have a question about getting started with open source. I\u2019ve been\
    \ coding for a while and will study computer science at university. How should\
    \ I begin contributing to open source?"
  sec: 1586
  time: '26:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: "It depends on what you want to achieve. If you want to start your own project,\
    \ ask if it\u2019s easier to maintain it and convince others to use it, or contribute\
    \ to an existing project. You can talk to maintainers and see if they\u2019re\
    \ interested in your contribution."
  sec: 1604
  time: '26:44'
  who: Vincent
- line: "If you\u2019re a maintainer, you understand the project well, but you might\
    \ not see what\u2019s unclear to new users. If you hit a confusing error, open\
    \ a GitHub issue suggesting improvements. That alone is already a contribution."
  sec: 1632
  time: '27:12'
  who: Vincent
- line: The first step is to use a tool, identify a problem, and create an issue.
    At Rasa, we have a contributor program. You can join via Slack, get PRs merged,
    give talks, or write blog posts, and we consider you a contributor.
  sec: 1680
  time: '28:00'
  who: Vincent
- line: "For your first commit, don\u2019t worry too much. Make sure you understand\
    \ setup.py, flake8, black, pytest, and pre-commit hooks. Understanding Git and\
    \ GitHub, including commits, merges, and pull requests, is also important."
  sec: 1720
  time: '28:40'
  who: Vincent
- line: Investing in these skills is sensible. Learn Python, Git, and GitHub basics,
    plus continuous integration and GitHub Actions. My site, Calmcod.io, has tutorials
    for all these tools. It helps you gain programming maturity beyond Jupyter notebooks.
  sec: 1795
  time: '29:55'
  who: Vincent
- line: "Let\u2019s say I want to contribute to a library like Psychic Learn. I know\
    \ some Python and Git. What are the next steps?"
  sec: 1813
  time: '30:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: "The path I took is different because I organized events. Most packages I\
    \ contribute to are maintained by someone I\u2019ve met in real life. That makes\
    \ it easier to discuss ideas."
  sec: 1832
  time: '30:32'
  who: Vincent
- line: Big projects like pandas have thousands of issues. Maintaining them is tricky.
    It may be better to start with a smaller library. Reach out on GitHub issues and
    see if maintainers are interested in your feature before starting work.
  sec: 1851
  time: '30:51'
  who: Vincent
- line: "I contributed to a project called Dion. It\u2019s a checklist for starting\
    \ a machine learning project, checking for unintended side effects before deployment.\
    \ They also accept anecdotes for documentation. It was a small, manageable way\
    \ to contribute."
  sec: 1891
  time: '31:31'
  who: Vincent
- line: "Dion is, as far as I\u2019m concerned, one of the most impactful projects\
    \ for preventing a lot of bad outcomes in machine learning. Dion is amazing. If\
    \ you haven\u2019t checked it out, you really should. We\u2019ll share the links\
    \ after the event."
  sec: 1920
  time: '32:00'
  who: Vincent
- line: "So your suggestion is that big projects like pandas or scikit-learn might\
    \ be too large to start contributing to. For example, in scikit-learn, there\u2019\
    s a policy where new algorithms must stand the test of time. You can\u2019t just\
    \ submit something you created yesterday."
  sec: 1938
  time: '32:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: "Exactly. Smaller projects are easier to get started with because the codebase\
    \ is smaller, there are fewer issues, and it\u2019s easier to communicate. The\
    \ main thing is psychological: maintainers worry about whether a feature is broadly\
    \ useful and whether contributors will stick around if something breaks."
  sec: 1968
  time: '32:48'
  who: Vincent
- line: "It\u2019s easier to have these conversations in a smaller project setting.\
    \ You can explain your interest in helping maintain the project. No one wants\
    \ to inherit legacy code without context."
  sec: 2015
  time: '33:35'
  who: Vincent
- line: 'Another question: how do you find the time and energy to work on so many
    side projects? You mentioned 10, 20, quite a few, in addition to your work at
    Rasa. Do you have any productivity tips?'
  sec: 2027
  time: '33:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: "A lot of my open source projects happen during my employer\u2019s time. Even\
    \ if it\u2019s not personal work, I\u2019m still learning and maintaining products\
    \ on the job, which translates to my open source work. My employer doesn\u2019\
    t mind, which makes it easier."
  sec: 2053
  time: '34:13'
  who: Vincent
- line: "I also realized after turning 30 that some activities, like video games,\
    \ weren\u2019t as fun as I thought. These days, I prefer hanging out with friends,\
    \ exercising, and spending time at home with my wife and cats."
  sec: 2084
  time: '34:44'
  who: Vincent
- line: I also use an e-ink drawing tablet. The most productive thing you can do is
    think through a technical problem before typing a single character. Having the
