- line: Thank you for joining. I will start with the introduction, and maybe more
    people will join by the time I finish. Thank you very much for coming to this
    meeting. This is an experimental event.

  time: 0:00
  who: Alexey
- line: This is the first time I am doing anything like that, and we will see how
    it goes. The idea is to have something without slides, to have a conversation.
    The topic for today is the roles in a data science team, or more broadly in a
    data team. We will talk about what kinds of roles exist and what responsibilities
    they have.

  who: Alexey
- line: For those who are not part of our DataTalks Club yet or who are not in Slack,
    you can join our Slack using the link join.datatalks.com. For questions today
    we will use Slido. To make it more interactive, we will experiment during the
    first session and see if Slido makes sense or if a discussion format works better.
  sec: 34
  time: 0:34
  who: Alexey
- line: I will stop sharing my screen because the idea for this session is to talk
    without slides. The plan is to record this session and release it as a podcast
    so people can listen while on the go without needing visuals. Let me share the
    link to the slides. If you have any questions during the talk, please use Slido
    to ask them.
  sec: 74
  time: '1:14'
  who: Alexey
- line: Let me start by quickly looking at my notes. The topic today is the roles
    in a data team. We want to understand what kinds of people work in a data team,
    what responsibilities they have, what they do, what they need to know, and what
    they do not need to know.
  sec: 116
  time: '1:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: Maybe first a few words about myself. I work as a lead data scientist, which
    means my views might be biased toward the perspective of a data scientist. This
    is how a data scientist sees other people in the team. I might not be right in
    all aspects, so if you think I am wrong somewhere, please tell me.
  sec: 145
  time: '2:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: My view of data engineers might be simplified because I do not see all the
    complexities of their work as a data scientist. Let us begin. In a data team there
    are many different roles. First, we have a product manager.
  sec: 192
  time: '3:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: A product manager is responsible for the product and for making sure the team
    is building the right thing. This role is usually less technical than the others.
    Then we have data specialists such as data analysts, data scientists, data engineers,
    and machine learning engineers. There is also a newer role called MLOps engineer.
  sec: 218
  time: '3:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: It is often difficult to understand who is who and who needs to do what. This
    is why we have this conversation today. In addition to these roles, there are
    more traditional engineering roles such as backend engineers, mobile engineers,
    and scientific engineers. All these people often work together with data scientists
    to create data science products.
  sec: 248
  time: '4:08'
  who: Alexey
- line: Let us start with core responsibilities. We will use an example. I work at
    OLX Group. OLX is a platform for online classifieds. It is a place where you can
    sell things you do not need.
  sec: 285
  time: '4:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: If you have an iPhone you want to sell, you go to the website, create a listing,
    and sell your iPhone. If you want to buy something, you go to OLX, browse advertisements,
    find what you like, and buy it. Now imagine we want to automatically detect the
    category of an item.
  sec: 298
  time: '4:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: If I am selling an iPhone and creating a listing, we want to understand that
    the iPhone should go into the mobile phones category. This is the example problem
    we will use for illustration. Let us start with the product manager.
  sec: 330
  time: '5:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: The main responsibility of a product manager is to make sure the team is building
    the right thing. They ensure that whatever service we create will be used by the
    user. Often teams solve problems, but the resulting services are not used, which
    is a common issue.
  sec: 347
  time: '5:47'
  who: Alexey
- line: The product manager exists to keep the team close to the user. They speak
    on behalf of the user. Their main skills are communication skills. For a data
    scientist communication might be a soft skill, but for a product manager it is
    a core professional skill.
  sec: 373
  time: '6:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: They also need to do prioritization and planning to decide what is important
    and what the team should focus on. Let us return to our example. If someone requests
    a feature for automatic listing categorization, the request first goes to a product
    manager.
  sec: 404
  time: '6:44'
  who: Alexey
- line: The product manager acts as a gateway for such requests. Their task is to
    determine whether users really need this feature and whether it is an important
    problem to solve. They often work with data analysts to evaluate if the problem
    is meaningful.
  sec: 443
  time: '7:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: The role of a data analyst is to understand the data and explain it to others.
    Analysts know what data exists in the company, how to retrieve it, and how to
    interpret it. They build dashboards and define KPIs.
  sec: 471
  time: '7:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: They track important business metrics such as profit, number of listings,
    or how many contacts buyers make with sellers. Analysts build reports for the
    executive team and provide actionable recommendations. Their main tools are SQL,
    a programming language such as Python or R, and dashboard tools like Tableau.
  sec: 504
  time: '8:24'
  who: Alexey
- line: They should know basic statistics for running experiments and some machine
    learning, such as regression analysis or time series forecasting. In our example,
    data analysts help quantify the problem for the product manager. They can determine
    how many users are affected by incorrect categorization.
  sec: 551
  time: '9:11'
  who: Alexey
- line: They can check how many users fail to finish creating a listing because they
    cannot select the right category. They can also check how many listings end up
    with the wrong category. Analysts fetch the data and confirm whether the problem
    is significant.
  sec: 594
  time: '9:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: Together with the product manager they decide if the problem is worth solving.
    If the answer is yes, the team begins working on the solution. Data analysts also
    help evaluate whether the resulting feature actually works.
  sec: 621
  time: '10:21'
  who: Alexey
- line: If we develop the categorization model, we want to know if it is effective.
    We usually run an experiment such as an A/B test. We check if fewer users drop
    out of the posting flow or if fewer ads end up in the wrong category.
  sec: 639
  time: '10:39'
  who: Alexey
- line: The analyst evaluates the experiment results and determines whether the model
    helps compared to not using a model. Now let us talk about data scientists. Data
    scientists and data analysts sometimes have similar roles.
  sec: 677
  time: '11:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: In some companies one person does both jobs. Typically, data analysts focus
    on explaining what is happening in the data, while data scientists focus on predicting.
    Analysts fetch and interpret data, while data scientists build machine learning
    models.
  sec: 702
  time: '11:42'
  who: Alexey
- line: They integrate these models into products. Their focus is more on engineering.
    In my opinion this is the main difference. Data scientists often work on incorporating
    predictive services into the product users interact with.
  sec: 730
  time: '12:10'
  who: Alexey
- line: Their key skills are machine learning, Python, and SQL. They also use tools
    like Flask and Docker to build simple web services for serving models. In our
    example, the data scientist develops the model that predicts the item category.
  sec: 765
  time: '12:45'
  who: Alexey
- line: Once they have the model, they create a simple service to host it. Now let
    us talk about data engineers. Data engineers handle all the heavy lifting surrounding
    data. For analysts and data scientists to use data, a lot of preparation is needed.
  sec: 803
  time: '13:23'
  who: Alexey
- line: Data engineers ensure all necessary data appears in a usable form. They make
    sure accessing this data does not affect the main product. They build what is
    often called a data lake where all user-generated data is captured and stored
    separately.
  sec: 838
  time: '13:58'
  who: Alexey
- line: Analysts can query this data, and data scientists can train models on it.
    Data engineers ensure analytical queries run smoothly. In larger companies they
    also handle access control so only authorized people can view sensitive data.
  sec: 872
  time: '14:32'
  who: Alexey
- line: They must prevent unauthorized access to personal data unless there is a valid
    business reason. Their skills typically include cloud platforms like AWS or Google
    Cloud, infrastructure tools like Kubernetes and Terraform, and data services like
    Kafka or RabbitMQ.
  sec: 912
  time: '15:12'
  who: Alexey
- line: These tools capture, process, and store data. Databases are where the data
    ends up so that others can use it.
  sec: 950
  time: '15:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: The data must be accessible for data analysts, and it must be available in
    a clean form. Data engineers also use orchestration tools such as Airflow to build
    complex data pipelines. In our example of creating a service for predicting the
    correct category for a listing, they ensure all required data is available. They
    make sure the data needed for analysis is present, so we can quantify the problem.
    They also ensure that the listing data required for prediction is stored properly.
  sec: 964
  time: '16:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is their main responsibility, but they are not the only type of engineers
    in the data team. There are other important engineering roles as well.
  sec: 1016
  time: '16:56'
  who: Alexey
- line: One of them is the machine learning engineer. A machine learning engineer
    takes what the data scientist built and scales it. They make sure the service
    is maintainable and follows best engineering practices. Their focus is more on
    engineering than on modeling.
  sec: 1024
  time: '17:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: When I say they take what the data scientist built, I do not mean the data
    scientist simply finishes the model and hands it over. Instead, they work side
    by side. Together they ensure the service is scalable, maintainable, and follows
    proper engineering principles. The collaboration continues until the system is
    ready for production use.
  sec: 1060
  time: '17:40'
  who: Alexey
- line: Their skills are similar to those of data engineers. They use cloud platforms,
    infrastructure tools like Kubernetes and Terraform, and programming languages
    such as Python. They often work closely with backend engineers, frontend engineers,
    or mobile engineers. This helps ensure the models are integrated into the final
    product that users interact with.
  sec: 1087
  time: '18:07'
  who: Alexey
- line: Does somebody have a question? I thought I heard some noise. I will continue.
  sec: 1118
  time: '18:38'
  who: Alexey
- line: In our example of predicting listing categories, machine learning engineers
    ideally work with data scientists to productionize the model. They make sure the
    model is stable under load. They ensure that once the system is rolled out, it
    remains maintainable. They also prepare it so future changes can be added when
    needed.
  sec: 1132
  time: '18:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: Another important type of engineer in a data team is the DevOps engineer or
    site reliability engineer. Their focus is on availability and reliability of services.
    They do not work strictly with data but instead concentrate on infrastructure.
    They handle networking, provisioning, and the servers where the services run.
  sec: 1166
  time: '19:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: They collect operational metrics such as CPU usage and request rates. They
    set up alerts and manage on call duties. Their goal is to ensure services run
    continuously without interruptions. If something breaks, site reliability engineers
    quickly diagnose the issue. They fix it themselves or involve other engineers
    when needed.
  sec: 1204
  time: '20:04'
  who: Alexey
- line: Their skills are similar to those of other engineers, so they must know cloud
    platforms and infrastructure tools. They use programming languages such as Python,
    but they also need deep knowledge of Unix or Linux. They must understand networking
    well. They follow best DevOps practices such as automation and continuous integration
    and delivery. Machine learning engineers and data engineers also follow these
    practices, but DevOps engineers focus on enforcing them.
  sec: 1254
  time: '20:54'
  who: Alexey
- line: You might have heard of an MLOps engineer. This has become a recent trend.
    In my opinion, even though people may disagree, an MLOps engineer is essentially
    a DevOps engineer who understands the basics of machine learning. They know what
    a model is, how probabilities work, and the phases of the machine learning lifecycle.
    They still focus mainly on operational support.
  sec: 1294
  time: '21:34'
  who: Alexey
- line: They continue to follow all DevOps practices. They ensure everyone else follows
    them. They set up continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines. Their
    responsibility is to keep the services developed by data scientists, machine learning
    engineers, and data engineers running reliably.
  sec: 1340
  time: '22:20'
  who: Alexey
- line: This was the overview of the main roles. To summarize, the product manager
    ensures the team builds the right thing and acts as the gateway for incoming requests.
    They stay close to the user. Data analysts are responsible for understanding and
    analyzing data, interpreting results, and building dashboards.
  sec: 1371
  time: '22:51'
  who: Alexey
- line: Data scientists build models and integrate them into the product. Data engineers
    prepare the data for analysts and data scientists. Machine learning engineers
    help scale machine learning services and establish strong engineering practices.
    Site reliability engineers focus on availability, reliability, and DevOps practices,
    ensuring everything stays up and running.
  sec: 1409
  time: '23:29'
  who: Alexey
- line: I received a question from Ankush in Slack about how data engineers can support
    others. I think I covered most of it earlier, but I want to make it more concrete.
    The best way for data engineers to support others is by working together as one
    team on the same problem. Even though the focus differs, working on the same goal
    improves collaboration.
  sec: 1457
  time: '24:17'
  who: Alexey
- line: If we are building a service that predicts categories correctly, everyone
    works together. Data engineers ensure the data needed for analysis and model training
    is available. If something is missing, they take care of making it accessible.
    They allow other team members to focus on modeling or analysis without worrying
    about data collection.
  sec: 1495
  time: '24:55'
  who: Alexey
- line: Sometimes models do not operate online. They are not web services running
    continuously. Instead, they run offline on a schedule, such as once per hour or
    once per day. In these situations we do not need a web service for serving predictions.
    An example is finding users who might be interested in particular listings.
  sec: 1527
  time: '25:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: We identify users who are most likely to react positively to specific advertisements.
    We usually do not need to do this in real time, so running it once per day is
    enough. We run the model, score all users, and identify the ones most likely to
    be interested. Then we send emails to them with the recommendations.
  sec: 1565
  time: '26:05'
  who: Alexey
- line: This is called batch serving because it happens periodically. In this case,
    the data engineer helps the data scientist execute the model on a schedule. They
    help ensure the model receives the correct input data. They also help store the
    output in a form that other services can use.
  sec: 1619
  time: '26:59'
  who: Alexey
- line: Let me check whether we have any questions. My Slido window disappeared for
    a moment.
  sec: 1672
  time: '27:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: The first question is about the difference between a machine learning engineer
    and a data engineer when scaling data science models. I partially answered this
    earlier. In my opinion and based on trends I see in companies, machine learning
    engineers mostly work on online systems. If a model must be served online, they
    handle that.
  sec: 1726
  time: '28:46'
  who: Alexey
- line: When something is offline and runs once per day, that is usually handled by
    data engineers. However, data engineers also work with tools like Kafka, which
    are real time. This makes the distinction less clear. In some companies there
    is no difference at all.
  sec: 1765
  time: '29:25'
  who: Alexey
- line: One way to separate the roles is to say that data engineers prepare data before
    model development. Machine learning engineers work with the model after it is
    developed. This separation is not strict, because the teams collaborate closely
    during all steps.
  sec: 1801
  time: '30:01'
  who: Alexey
- line: Another question is whether the team should have a business analyst between
    the product manager and the data team. Yes, I think this is a good idea. A business
    analyst can greatly help.
  sec: 1848
  time: '30:48'
  who: Alexey
- line: What they call an analyst varies. Sometimes roles differ between product analysts,
    data analysts, and business analysts. Sometimes it is the same role, so it can
    be difficult to draw a clear line. They are similar in that they help the product
    manager quantify the size of a problem. They also help understand whether this
    problem is worth solving.
  sec: 1873
  time: '31:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: In some teams there is no product manager and only a business analyst. This
    person translates the user requirements to the team. That approach can also work.
  sec: 1873
  time: '31:13'
  who: Alexey
- line: What communication or soft skills are required in different positions? The
    main soft skill is communication in my opinion. Everyone should be able to talk
    to each other and understand each other. Product managers are less technical,
    data engineers and machine learning engineers are more technical, and site reliability
    engineers focus even more on technical Unix skills.
  sec: 1926
  time: '32:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: Everyone in the team needs to speak the same language. When a data scientist
    describes a machine learning problem, they must ensure the team understands what
    they mean. Instead of going deep into details like gradients exploding, they should
    explain the problem in a way that is clear to others. Using metaphors can help.
  sec: 1926
  time: '32:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: For analysts, writing documentation is important. Documentation for engineers
    is usually intended for other engineers, but analysts often write for management.
    They need to write in a way that helps executives understand the problem and the
    proposed solution. This includes reports and summaries.
  sec: 1926
  time: '32:06'
  who: Alexey
- line: What roles depend on the size of the team? For example, would you see a machine
    learning engineer in a small team or only later in development? It depends on
    the company. There was a trend when companies believed they could hire one data
    scientist who would solve all problems.
  sec: 2075
  time: '34:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: This was not true because they later realized they needed data engineers,
    machine learning engineers, and analysts. In a small company, a data engineer
    who knows some machine learning can be enough. It could also be a machine learning
    engineer who knows how to set up data pipelines. Ideally, it is someone who can
    do things end-to-end.
  sec: 2075
  time: '34:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: A machine learning engineer could be such a person if they know how to build
    pipelines, train a model, and serve it. This person can bring value early by solving
    business problems with simple models. After showing value, the team can grow by
    adding data engineers and data scientists. There is no right or wrong answer because
    it depends on what the company wants to achieve.
  sec: 2075
  time: '34:35'
  who: Alexey
- line: Do data engineers work on big data? If the data is small, the definition of
    big data becomes unclear. But if a system processes a few million or even one
    hundred million events per day, that qualifies as big data. In that case, you
    need a dedicated person focused on processing this data. A data scientist alone
    cannot handle that volume.
  sec: 2246
  time: '37:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: A data engineer will ensure the data can be processed, stored in the right
    format, and accessed by others. If the company is small and does not generate
    heavy data loads, even a data scientist without a strong engineering background
    can build the first prototype.
  sec: 2246
  time: '37:26'
  who: Alexey
- line: 'Is there a needed separation between full stack machine learning developers,
    backend full stack data science model deployment, and frontend full stack developers?
    To rephrase the question: do we need different kinds of full stack engineers?
    We have full stack data scientists who can do things end-to-end, and full stack
    web engineers who can develop web applications.'
  sec: 2332
  time: '38:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: The nature of the work is different. A full stack web engineer focuses on
    creating applications that users interact with. This process differs from data
    science. Full stack data scientists focus more on data science and backend work.
  sec: 2332
  time: '38:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: I do not see a strong connection between these roles, but early stage startups
    might have one person doing everything. This includes setting up the website,
    collecting data, training the model, and configuring routers. As the company grows,
    roles separate. Larger companies eventually have all the roles we discussed.
  sec: 2332
  time: '38:52'
  who: Alexey
- line: If a small team has no machine learning ops or devops engineer, who performs
    the task? In my opinion, it would be an engineer already in the team. If the company
    has a backend engineer, that person can be trained to understand the basics of
    machine learning. They can then perform the required tasks.
  sec: 2490
  time: '41:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: At some point the company will need to hire or grow someone into this role.
    If someone wants to add something or clarify a question, they can.
  sec: 2490
  time: '41:30'
  who: Alexey
- line: It would be good to put together a roles and responsibilities matrix when
    making this available online. I already have notes from today and will share them.
    It is possible to put the information into a matrix format. We can do that after
    the meeting.
  sec: 2538
  time: '42:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: Thank you. I do not know how it went. To me it was fun, but maybe it was too
    much talking and not many slides. I would like to hear your opinion about this
    event. We may do something similar next week.
  sec: 2538
  time: '42:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: I am not sure if I should include slides next time. Please share your thoughts
    in Slack or now if you want.
  sec: 2538
  time: '42:18'
  who: Alexey
- line: We are wrapping up for today. Thank you for attending the session. I look
    forward to seeing you next week. On Tuesday we have a talk about duplicate detection
    with Siamese networks. On Friday we will talk about processes similar to today.
    Talk to you soon. Goodbye.
