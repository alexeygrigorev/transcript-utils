    \ a very special guest today, Christoph. Christoph has a PhD in interpretable\
    \ machine learning from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. He worked\
    \ for a while in both academia and industry and now, he is a full-time tech writer.\
    \ He has written many technical books. If you're watching this video, there is\
    \ a bookshelf behind Christoph. Yeah, with all these four books at the top \u2013\
    \ we'll probably talk about some of them today. It's a great pleasure to have\
    \ you, Christoph. Welcome to the show."

  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah. My background is in different phases. Phase one was the classic statistician\
    \ education, I would say \u2013 a Bachelor\u2019s in statistics, Master\u2019\
    s and statistics \u2013 very classic, hypothesis testing and stuff like this.\
    \ In the end, I was already a bit drawn to machine learning \u2013 I did Kaggle\
    \ competitions and stuff. Right after I finished my Master\u2019s, I went to industry."

    \ then two years as a more classic statistician, where I worked in medical research.\
    \ During that time, I already started writing the book Interpretable Machine Learning,\
    \ because I had a part-time position. I just had different side projects and one\
    \ of them was the book. That's a bit ironic, because after my Master's thesis,\
    \ (I really hated my master's thesis \u2013  the writing process. So it's quite\
    \ ironic that I picked up writing again. And as I was"

    \ me. When I was writing the book, it kind of took the fear out of writing again\
    \ for me, because the main reason I also didn't do a PhD was, \u201COh, I have\
    \ to write papers. I hate writing. I hated my Master thesis, so I should not do\

  who: Alexey
- line: "Yeah, because\u2026 I don't know. For the Master's thesis, I was very stressed\

    \ to my supervisor, and then he would say, \u201CHmm\u2026 Something doesn't seem\
    \ right. Maybe you need another half a year.\u201D Right?"
  sec: 208
  time: '3:28'
  who: Alexey
- line: "[chuckles] Yeah. And I also didn't feel so free when writing the Master's\
    \ thesis. But when I started the book, I wrote it in the open, got feedback, and\
    \ could just write how I felt. I [could] put in some jokes and not hide behind\
    \ math or anything, just say, \u201COkay, this is like this.\u201D I use analogies\
    \ and stuff like that. So I enjoyed this part very much, which then led me to\
    \ do a PhD. So [I went] back to academia. Then I, again, learned to hate writing.\
    \ [chuckles] So I really hated writing papers. But still, I finished my PhD. This\
    \ was one year ago. Then I actually tried a postdoc job for a few months and another\
    \ job in industry for a few months, and it didn't feel right, kind of. I quit\
    \ both very quickly."

  who: Christoph
- line: "Then I thought back, \u201COkay, what's left? What can I do?\u201D Because\
    \ I now have quit all these things. So I looked back and the only constant thing\
    \ was writing for me, which I always enjoyed. Then I decided, \u201CYeah, why\
    \ not do this full time?\u201D I already had my first book, so I had a little\
    \ bit of income from that book and already a somewhat established reader base\
    \ and some experience. So I jumped into this, and I've been doing this now for\
    \ a year and a half and yeah \u2013 it has worked out so far. [chuckles]"

    \ up in their career in terms of how much they earn. For me, each career step\
    \ was a little less money, [chuckles] which is a bit funny, but I have so much\
    \ freedom that I don't regret it. But when I started, my first job was in Switzerland.\
    \ My second job was a part-time job so it was a little bit less. Then back to\
    \ Munich, a little bit less. [chuckles] And now, with my writing, again, a little\
    \ bit less than a PhD. But I think a full-time PhD is not\u2026 I mean, it could\
    \ earn more, of course, now if I would go for a regular data scientist role. But\

    \ machine learning. My first models were a linear regression model and a generalized\
    \ additive model. I think it was something with diabetes, but I\u2019m not sure\
    \ entirely what the topic was. But I remembered that I was really, really bad\
    \ at the competition. [laughs] And this was also like this for me. Because in\
    \ theory, I mean, I knew how to model data, how to build a prediction model \u2013\
    \ but just from a statistician point of view, not from a machine learning point\
    \ of view. My first thoughts were something like, \u201COkay, this should be a\
    \ generalized additive model with these features.\u201D I didn't even have a validation\
    \ set up on my side and haven't fully understood\u2026"

    \ you were doing during your Master\u2019s? Or is it something you needed to do\
    \ at your work (in that tech startup)? What led you to it?"
  sec: 470
  time: '7:50'
  who: Alexey
- line: "For me, it was quite natural, I think. Because as a statistician, you always\
    \ think about the data generating process. And when you build model\u044B, they're\
    \ usually interpretable. \u0415his is the mindset I came from, \u201COkay, let's\
    \ understand the data. Let's build an understandable model.\u201D And when I transitioned\
    \ more into machine learning, this was kind of lost \u2013 not fully, because\
    \ there were things like random forests, which would have this built-in feature\
    \ importance and stuff like this. But it felt like, \u201COkay, there are parts\
    \ missing.\u201D Then, during my second job in Switzerland, I had these side projects\
    \ and during one day off, I read a line paper, which is about an interpretability\
    \ method that fits linear models to explain individual predictions of more complex\
    \ models."
  sec: 483
  time: '8:03'
  who: Christoph
- line: "This was quite fascinating to me, like, \u201COh, well, we could have a really\
    \ complex model and then I'll still have a chance to understand what's going on\
    \ inside the model.\u201D I wanted to learn more, but I couldn't learn more because\
    \ there was not that much material online. That was my motivation to write a book\
    \ about this topic. I was quite lucky with the timing as well, because there was\
    \ nothing on the market yet [about that]."

- header: Interpretability vs Accuracy
- line: "Speaking of Kaggle \u2013 in Kaggle, they don't really care about the explainability/interpretability.\
    \ All they care about is predictions. Right? You care about all these predictions\
    \ and it doesn't matter how exactly the model is making these predictions. Sometimes\
    \ it works. At work, you also have similar situations \u2013 like churn/not churn.\
    \ Maybe if it's a lot of users, you don't really go and dig deeper into each individual\
    \ user when you want to understand why a particular decision happened."
  sec: 567
  time: '9:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: "As long as the business metrics are satisfied, everyone is happy, then you\
    \ just stack more layers \u2013 or, I don't know, do something. You don't necessarily\
    \ go and try to figure out why the model was wrong for this particular customer.\
    \ I imagine there are many, many cases, especially in medical research, where\
    \ you do have to care about this."
  sec: 567
  time: '9:27'
  who: Alexey
- line: "I think I don't fully agree with the Kaggle case because in Kaggle, of course,\
    \ what gets you the money is to be right with your predictions. I think interpretability\
    \ can help you even with Kaggle (go to the back a little). A really stupid example,\
    \ but I'm doing a competition at the moment. When I created the futures, I kind\
    \ of had a target leakage because a version of my target, I put into my features.\
    \ But I also had interpretability at the end of the model, to look at the feature\
    \ importance using SHAP and immediately\u2026 So first of all, I saw the prediction\
    \ error go down by a lot."
  sec: 628
  time: '10:28'
  who: Christoph
- line: "I was super happy. But then a little voice in my head said, \u201CThis is\
    \ not true. Don't be happy. There's something wrong with your model.\u201D And\
    \ it turned out to be wrong. I super quickly found the bug. For the feature importance\
    \ ranking, this one feature bubbled to the top. Now, you won\u2019t need feature\
    \ importance for this, of course, because you could check your column names, for\
    \ example. But if you have a large feature set, then it's quite tedious to look\
    \ through all of them. For these interpretation methods, if you have a similar\
    \ mistake, like target leakage it just bubbles the most important feature to the\
    \ top. So I would say interpretability is useful for debugging your model."

    \ write my newsletter, or when I pick a new book \u2013 when I already know the\
    \ topic, I feel like there's not that much value in it, which is obviously wrong\
    \ because, at some point, I didn't know these things. At this point in the past,\
    \ I would have loved to read about them. But for me, it feels like if it's too\
    \ easy to write about, it's not worth writing about it. This is obviously wrong\

    \ always feel like I also have to learn it right now. But also, one of the reasons\
    \ why I became a writer was so that I could always learn new things. It's kind\
    \ of like a dance between these two things \u2013 it should be simple, so I can\

    \ chapter by chapter. It didn't feel like one huge chunk \u2013 like a huge mountain\
    \ to climb \u2013 but little steps. I think if I hadn't gotten any feedback in\
    \ the beginning, (I shared it on Twitter, for example) I\u2019m not sure if I\

    \ \u2013 there are many different algorithms \u2013 and they conformalize this\
    \ uncertainty measure so that you can trust your output. For example, you could\
    \ have a classifier that outputs class probabilities and you could use conformal\
    \ prediction to say that, instead of outputting one class or just the probabilities,\
    \ you get a set with some guarantees (that's important part, these guarantees)\
    \ of probability that has like a 95% chance that there are correct classes within\

    \ bit similar to these model-agnostic interpretability techniques, in so far that\
    \ you can first train your model (any model, really \u2013 it could be random\
    \ forest, it could be neural network) and then apply the method afterwards. Because,\
    \ at least for some classes of conformal prediction, which are called inductive\
    \ conformal prediction, these can apply to your model after you've trained it.\
    \ The idea is that you have a calibration step so you can use some output from\
    \ a model which quantifies the uncertainty and kind of calibrates it the right\

    readers. I think one problem is, of course, if you have a very problematic part,
    then all the readers will comment on this part. It's also not so good that you
    give this version to a lot of people. One lesson for me was to keep the list of
    readers small. You shouldn't have too many beta readers, I think. Rather, you
    should have more phases where you invite a few readers, incorporate the feedback,
    and have a new version of new readers for this new version. That's what worked
    best for me so far. But, of course, it prolongs the process of how long it takes
